# Security Policy

Parmana is execution trust infrastructure: it authorizes and evidences
what automated systems do. A vulnerability here has more impact than in a
typical application, so we take reports seriously and ask that you
report privately rather than through a public issue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email **founder@parmanasystems.com** with:

- A description of the issue and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept if you have one.
- The commit or version affected.

We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days and aim to give
you a fix timeline or a clarifying question within 10. Please give us a
reasonable window to fix and deploy before any public disclosure.

## Scope

In scope: the runtime, policy engine, execution gateway, cryptographic
signing and verification, the connector SDK and its Razorpay connector,
the REST API and its authentication/webhook handling, and the envelope
verifier. See [docs/CLAIMS.md](docs/CLAIMS.md) for exactly what each of
these claims to do today.

Out of scope: findings that require a compromised signing key or
compromised infrastructure to demonstrate (see
[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)'s Security Assumptions section),
denial-of-service against the demo deployments, and social engineering.

## Acknowledged reports

We are happy to credit reporters by name in release notes, with your
permission, once a fix ships.
