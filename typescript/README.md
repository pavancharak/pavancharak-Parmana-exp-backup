# Parmana TypeScript SDK

The official TypeScript SDK for **Parmana**.

Parmana ensures that only Parmana-approved actions are executed.

Parmana is an **Execution Trust Infrastructure** for AI systems.

It ensures that autonomous systems execute **only policy-compliant actions** and produces cryptographically verifiable evidence for every execution.

---

# Why Parmana?

Modern AI systems can make decisions autonomously, but organizations need assurance that those decisions comply with business policies before execution.

Parmana provides that assurance.

Using Parmana, organizations can:

- Execute only policy-compliant actions
- Produce verifiable execution evidence
- Build an auditable authorization-to-execution trust chain
- Independently verify every execution
- Support governance and regulatory compliance

---

# Core Principle

Parmana does not execute business actions.

Parmana authorizes execution.

Only Parmana-approved actions are executed.

# Installation

```bash
npm install @parmana/typescript-sdk
```

---

# Quick Start

```typescript
import {
    ParmanaClient,
    HttpTransport,
} from "@parmana/typescript-sdk";

const client = new ParmanaClient({
    endpoint: "https://runtime.example.com",

    transport: new HttpTransport({
        endpoint: "https://runtime.example.com",
    }),
});
```

---

# Runtime Health

```typescript
const health =
    await client.health();
```

---

# Execute

```typescript
const trustRecord =
    await client.execute(
        transaction,
    );
```

The Runtime:

1. Loads the requested policy.
2. Evaluates policy deterministically.
3. Produces a Decision.
4. Enforces execution approval.
5. Executes the Runtime Pipeline.
6. Produces an Execution Trust Record.

---

# Verify

```typescript
const verification =
    await client.getLatestVerification(
        trustRecord.businessTransactionId,
    );
```

Verification independently validates the Execution Trust Record.

---

# Replay

```typescript
const replay =
    await client.replay(
        trustRecord.businessTransactionId,
    );
```

Replay deterministically re-executes the recorded execution.

---

# Validate Policy

```typescript
const result =
    await client.validatePolicy(
        policy,
    );
```

Policy validation checks that a policy is structurally valid before deployment.

---

# SDK Architecture

```
ParmanaClient
│
├── HealthApi
├── ExecutionApi
├── VerificationApi
├── ReplayApi
├── ReceiptApi
├── TransactionApi
├── TrustRecordApi
└── PolicyApi
```

The client is intentionally small.

Each API encapsulates a single Parmana capability.

---

# Canonical Domain Model

The SDK re-exports the canonical Parmana domain model from `@parmana/shared`.

Core artifacts include:

- Authority
- Authorization
- Intent
- PolicyReference
- BusinessTransaction
- Decision
- Execution
- ExecutionEvidence
- ExecutionTrustRecord
- Verification
- Receipt
- Override

The SDK does not redefine these models.

---

# Error Handling

All SDK exceptions inherit from:

```typescript
ParmanaError
```

Common errors include:

- ConfigurationError
- ValidationError
- ExecutionRejectedError
- VerificationError
- ReplayError
- NetworkError
- TimeoutError
- InternalServerError

---

# Configuration

```typescript
const configuration = {
    endpoint: "...",
    transport: ...,
};
```

The SDK configuration controls communication with the Parmana Runtime.

It does not control policy evaluation or runtime behavior.

No route in the Parmana API enforces authentication or authorization today; every request is accepted from any caller who can reach the port (see docs/CLAIMS.md, "API-layer authentication and authorization"). The SDK configuration has no credentials field for that reason — do not build a client that assumes one.

# About Parmana

Parmana is an Execution Trust Infrastructure for autonomous and AI systems.

It establishes a cryptographically verifiable trust chain linking:

Authority → Authorization → Intent → Policy → Decision → Execution → Evidence → Verification

This enables organizations to confidently deploy AI in high-impact workflows while maintaining governance, auditability, and independent verification.
