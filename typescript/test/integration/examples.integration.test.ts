/**
 * Parmana TypeScript SDK
 *
 * Proves the documented example this repo ships
 * (typescript/examples/02-execute.ts, the closest TS equivalent to
 * python/examples/quickstart/run.py) actually works against a real
 * running server -- not just that it compiles. Neither example was
 * previously exercised by any test: typescript/examples/ is excluded
 * from typescript/tsconfig.json's own include list, so nothing ever
 * built or ran it, and it silently imported a package name
 * (@parmana/typescript-sdk) that has never existed in this repo, plus
 * two further bugs (AuthorityType/BusinessTransactionStatus used as
 * runtime enums that don't exist on this SDK's string-typed models;
 * client.replay() passed an object where it takes a plain string) --
 * all found and fixed by this dogfooding pass, not hypothetical.
