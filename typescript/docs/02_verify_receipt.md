\# Example 02 — Verify Receipt



\## Overview



After a Business Transaction has been executed, Parmana produces cryptographic artifacts that allow the execution to be independently verified.



This example demonstrates how to verify an Execution Trust Record using the TypeScript SDK.



Verification is a core capability of Parmana because it allows a third party to determine whether an execution occurred exactly as recorded, without relying on trust in the executing application.

\# Learning Objectives



After completing this guide you will understand:



\* Why verification exists

\* The purpose of a Receipt

\* The purpose of a Verification artifact

\* How to verify an Execution Trust Record

\* How verification differs from execution

\* How verification supports independent audit



\---



\# Prerequisites



Before completing this example you should understand:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* PolicyReference

\* BusinessTransaction



If not, complete:



```text

docs/01\_basic\_execution.md

```



first.



\---



\# Why Verification?



Execution answers:



> Did the system perform the requested operation?



Verification answers:



> Can someone independently prove that the recorded execution is authentic and internally consistent?



Execution and verification are intentionally separate activities.



\---



\# Execution Trust Chain



Verification operates on an existing Execution Trust Record.



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

Authorization

&#x20;     │

Intent

&#x20;     │

PolicyReference

&#x20;     │

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

Decision

&#x20;     │

Execution

&#x20;     │

Execution Evidence

&#x20;     │

Receipt

&#x20;     │

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;     │

Verification

```



Verification never modifies the trust chain.



It produces another immutable trust artifact.



\---



\# What Is Verified?



The verification process examines the complete trust chain, including:



\* Business Transaction identifiers

\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* Policy Reference

\* Decision

\* Execution

\* Execution Evidence

\* Trust Record Hash

\* Receipt integrity



Every component contributes to the verification result.



\---



\# Creating the Client



```typescript

import { ParmanaClient } from "@parmana/typescript-sdk";



const client = new ParmanaClient({

&#x20;   endpoint: "http://localhost:8080",

});

```



\---



\# Loading the Trust Record



Normally the Runtime or storage layer returns an `ExecutionTrustRecord`.



```typescript

const trustRecord = getExecutionTrustRecord();

```



For the SDK example, a placeholder trust record is used.



\---



\# Verify the Trust Record



Verification requires only one call.



```typescript

const verification =

&#x20;   await client.verify(trustRecord);

```



The SDK sends the trust record to the Parmana Runtime, which performs deterministic verification.



\---



\# Verification Result



A successful verification returns a `Verification` object.



```typescript

console.log(

&#x20;   verification.verificationId

);



console.log(

&#x20;   verification.status

);



console.log(

&#x20;   verification.verifiedAt

);

```



Typical output:



```text

Verification ID



verification-001



Status



VERIFIED



Verified



2026-06-29T12:54:17Z

```



\---



\# Internal Verification Process



Although the SDK exposes a single method, the Runtime performs multiple validation steps.



```text

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;       │

Validate Structure

&#x20;       │

Validate References

&#x20;       │

Validate Policy

&#x20;       │

Validate Decision

&#x20;       │

Validate Execution

&#x20;       │

Validate Receipt

&#x20;       │

Compute Trust Hash

&#x20;       │

Return Verification

```



Each step is deterministic.



\---



\# Trust Record Hash



Every Execution Trust Record has a canonical hash.



```text

trustRecordHash

```



The verifier recomputes this value.



If the computed hash differs from the recorded hash, verification fails.



\---



\# Why Hashes Matter



Hashes provide tamper evidence.



Changing even one field produces a completely different digest.



For example:



```text

Original



Authority = Acme



Hash



91df6c...



Modified



Authority = Other



Hash



4af20e...

```



Verification immediately detects the modification.



\---



\# Verification Status



Current statuses include:



```text

VERIFIED



FAILED

```



Future versions may introduce additional diagnostic states, while preserving the deterministic verification model.



\---



\# Error Handling



Always handle verification failures.



```typescript

try {



&#x20;   const verification =

&#x20;       await client.verify(record);



}

catch(error){



&#x20;   console.error(error);



}

```



Verification may fail because:



\* Runtime unavailable

\* Invalid trust record

\* Corrupted receipt

\* Hash mismatch

\* Authorization inconsistency

\* Missing execution artifacts



\---



\# Verification vs Replay



Verification confirms integrity.



Replay reproduces execution.



Verification asks:



> Is this execution authentic?



Replay asks:



> Would the same inputs produce the same outcome?



Both capabilities complement each other but serve different purposes.



\---



\# Independent Verification



One of Parmana's design goals is independent verification.



The verifier does not need access to:



\* Original application

\* Original source code

\* Original database



Only the Execution Trust Record and verification logic are required.



This separation improves transparency and auditability.



\---



\# Security Benefits



Verification provides:



\* Tamper detection

\* Evidence validation

\* Cryptographic integrity

\* Audit support

\* Regulatory compliance

\* Independent assurance



\---



\# Architectural Principles



Verification is:



\* Deterministic

\* Repeatable

\* Immutable

\* Independent

\* Non-destructive



It never changes the original execution artifacts.

\# Relationship to Later Examples

\# Summary



In this example you learned:



\* Why verification exists

\* How to verify an Execution Trust Record

\* The role of the Verification artifact

\* The importance of trust hashes

\* How Parmana detects tampering

\* Why verification is independent of execution



Verification transforms execution evidence into independently provable evidence that can be audited, replayed, and trusted across organizational boundaries.
