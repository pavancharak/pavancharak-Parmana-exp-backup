\# Example 04 — Audit the Execution Trust Chain



\## Overview



One of Parmana's primary goals is to make AI execution independently auditable.



Most systems record logs.



Parmana records an immutable \*\*Execution Trust Record\*\*, allowing an auditor to reconstruct exactly what happened, why it happened, who authorized it, which policy was applied, what decision was made, what executed, and what evidence was produced.



This guide demonstrates how to inspect and audit an `ExecutionTrustRecord` using the TypeScript SDK.



\---



\# Learning Objectives



After completing this guide you will understand:



\* The purpose of an Execution Trust Record

\* What information auditors require

\* How to inspect a complete trust chain

\* How immutable artifacts support governance

\* How auditing differs from verification and replay



\---



\# Prerequisites



Complete the previous guides:



\* `docs/01\_basic\_execution.md`

\* `docs/02\_verify\_receipt.md`

\* `docs/03\_replay\_execution.md`



You should already understand:



\* BusinessTransaction

\* Receipt

\* Verification

\* Replay



\---



\# Why Audit?



Execution answers:



> What happened?



Verification answers:



> Is the execution authentic?



Replay answers:



> Can the execution be reproduced?



Audit answers:



> Is the entire business process understandable, explainable, and independently reviewable?



Auditing is broader than verification.

\# The Execution Trust Record



The Execution Trust Record is the canonical representation of everything Parmana knows about a Business Transaction.



```text

ExecutionTrustRecord

│

├── BusinessTransaction

│   ├── Authority

│   ├── Authorization

│   ├── Intent

│   └── PolicyReference

│

├── Overrides

│

├── Executions

│   ├── Decision

│   ├── Evidence

│   └── Metadata

│

├── Verifications

│

├── Receipts

│

└── Trust Record Hash

```



Nothing is hidden.



Everything required for governance is contained within this aggregate.



\---



\# Audit Workflow



```text

Business Transaction

&#x20;       │

Execute

&#x20;       │

Verification

&#x20;       │

Replay

&#x20;       │

Audit

```



Auditing typically occurs after execution but may be performed repeatedly throughout the lifetime of a trust record.



\---



\# Loading a Trust Record



An auditor begins by obtaining the immutable Execution Trust Record.



```typescript

const trustRecord = getExecutionTrustRecord();

```



In the SDK example, a placeholder trust record is provided for demonstration.



\---



\# Inspecting the Trust Record



The SDK example walks through the major sections.



```typescript

console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.trustRecordId

);



console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.businessTransactionId

);

```



These identifiers uniquely identify the audited execution.



\---



\# Reviewing the Business Transaction



The Business Transaction explains \*\*why execution was requested\*\*.



Review:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* PolicyReference



Example:



```typescript

console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.transaction.authority.authorityName

);



console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.transaction.intent.operation

);



console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.transaction.policy.policyName

);

```



\---



\# Reviewing Authority



Authority answers:



> Who owns this business decision?



Example:



```text

Acme Corporation

```



Authority establishes organizational accountability.



\---



\# Reviewing Authorization



Authorization answers:



> Who was permitted to execute?



Example:



```text

warehouse-robot-01

```



Authorization confirms that execution was permitted under organizational policy.



\---



\# Reviewing Intent



Intent answers:



> What business action was requested?



Example:



```text

MOVE\_PALLET

```



Intent remains immutable throughout the lifecycle of the transaction.



\---



\# Reviewing the Policy Reference



PolicyReference identifies exactly which governance policy was evaluated.



```text

warehouse-policy



Version 1.0.0

```



Historical replay always uses this recorded version.



\---



\# Reviewing Executions



The Execution history records what actually happened.



```typescript

for (const execution of trustRecord.executions) {



&#x20;   console.log(

&#x20;       execution.executionId

&#x20;   );



}

```



Each execution contains:



\* Decision

\* Status

\* Mode

\* Evidence

\* Metadata



\---



\# Reviewing Decisions



Every execution contains exactly one immutable Decision.



Review:



\* Decision ID

\* Outcome

\* Reason

\* Signals

\* Evaluated Time



Example:



```text

Outcome



APPROVED

```



\---



\# Reviewing Runtime Signals



Signals explain \*\*why\*\* the decision was produced.



Example:



```typescript

console.log(

&#x20;   execution.decision.signals

);

```



Signals become part of deterministic replay.



\---



\# Reviewing Execution Evidence



Evidence explains what occurred during execution.



Examples:



\* API response

\* File identifier

\* Vehicle telemetry

\* Medical recommendation

\* Payment reference



Evidence depends on the executing application.



\---



\# Reviewing Human Overrides



Some executions require human approval.



The trust record preserves override history.



```typescript

console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.overrides.length

);

```



Each override records:



\* Approver

\* Reason

\* Justification

\* Approval time



\---



\# Reviewing Verification History



Verification is append-only.



Every verification becomes part of the trust chain.



```typescript

console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.verifications.length

);

```



Auditors can determine:



\* When verification occurred

\* Which trust record was verified

\* Whether verification succeeded



\---



\# Reviewing Receipts



Receipts are cryptographic attestations of execution.



```typescript

console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.receipts.length

);

```



Typical receipt information includes:



\* Receipt ID

\* Signature

\* Algorithm

\* Trust Record Hash

\* Issued Time



\---



\# Reviewing the Trust Record Hash



Every Execution Trust Record has a canonical digest.



```typescript

console.log(

&#x20;   trustRecord.trustRecordHash

);

```



The hash enables independent integrity validation.



\---



\# Complete Audit Checklist



A complete audit should answer:



\* Who authorized execution?

\* Who executed?

\* What was requested?

\* Which policy was evaluated?

\* Which runtime signals were used?

\* What decision was produced?

\* What evidence was recorded?

\* Was execution verified?

\* Was replay successful?

\* Was a receipt generated?



If every answer is available, the trust chain is complete.



\---



\# Audit vs Traditional Logging



Traditional logs typically contain isolated events.



Parmana provides an immutable, structured trust chain.



| Traditional Logs      | Parmana Audit                |

| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |

| Individual events     | Complete execution history   |

| Mutable               | Immutable                    |

| Partial context       | Full business context        |

| Difficult correlation | Single trust record          |

| Weak provenance       | Cryptographically verifiable |

for the complete implementation.



\---



\# Architectural Principles



Auditing in Parmana is based on:



\* Immutable records

\* Explicit authority

\* Explicit authorization

\* Explicit intent

\* Explicit policy selection

\* Deterministic execution

\* Independent verification

\* Replayable evidence



These principles ensure that every governed execution can be reviewed years after it occurred.



\---



\# Summary



In this guide you learned how to audit an Execution Trust Record by inspecting:



\* Business Transaction

\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* PolicyReference

\* Executions

\* Decisions

\* Runtime Signals

\* Evidence

\* Overrides

\* Verifications

\* Receipts

\* Trust Record Hash



Together these artifacts provide a complete, explainable, and independently auditable record of execution.
