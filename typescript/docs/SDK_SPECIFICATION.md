Parmana SDK Specification v1.0

Purpose



The Parmana SDK provides the canonical developer interface for interacting with the Parmana Execution Trust Infrastructure.



The SDK abstracts the internal implementation of Parmana and exposes a stable, product-oriented API.



The SDK does not expose internal runtime, policy, replay, or verification components directly.



Design Principles

One SDK, one client.

Same conceptual API across all languages.

Stable domain model.

Strong typing.

Deterministic behavior.

Language idiomatic, conceptually identical.

Thin client over the Parmana platform.

Canonical Client

ParmanaClient



Every operation starts from this client.



Canonical Operations

execute()



verify()



replay()



audit()



validatePolicy()



health()



These are the only top-level operations in v1.



Canonical Domain Models

Authority



Authorization



Intent



PolicyReference



BusinessTransaction



Decision



Execution



ExecutionEvidence



Receipt



ExecutionTrustRecord



Verification



ReplayResult



Override



No SDK-specific business models.



Error Hierarchy

ParmanaError



ValidationError



AuthorizationError



ExecutionRejectedError



VerificationError



ReplayError



ConfigurationError



NetworkError

Credentials

Domain Models



Exceptions



Everything else is internal.



Internal Components



These must not be exposed:



RuntimeEngine



PolicyEngine



ExecutionGate



DecisionBuilder



ExecutionBuilder



RuntimePipeline



ExecutionTrustPipeline



PolicyRouter



These remain implementation details.



Language Parity



The TypeScript and Python SDKs must expose the same conceptual capabilities.



For example:



TypeScript



const client = new ParmanaClient(config);



await client.execute(transaction);



await client.verify(trustRecord);



await client.replay(request);



Python



client = ParmanaClient(config)



await client.execute(transaction)



await client.verify(trust\_record)



await client.replay(request)



The syntax may follow language conventions, but the concepts and operations remain the same.
