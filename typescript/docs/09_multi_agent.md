\# Example 09 — Multi-Agent Governance



\## Overview



Modern AI systems increasingly consist of \*\*multiple specialized agents\*\* rather than a single monolithic model.



A customer request might involve:



\* A planning agent

\* A research agent

\* A reasoning agent

\* A coding agent

\* A validation agent

\* An execution agent



While these agents collaborate to complete a business objective, organizations still require confidence that the overall workflow is:



\* Authorized

\* Governed by policy

\* Deterministic

\* Replayable

\* Independently verifiable

\* Fully auditable



Parmana provides this governance by recording the entire multi-agent workflow as a single immutable \*\*Execution Trust Record\*\*.



This guide demonstrates how coordinated AI agents operate under a shared trust chain using the TypeScript SDK.



\---



\# Learning Objectives



After completing this guide you will understand:



\* Why multi-agent systems require governance

\* How multiple agents share one Business Transaction

\* How agent outputs become execution evidence

\* How replay reproduces coordinated workflows

\* How auditing spans every participating agent



\---



\# Why Multi-Agent Systems Need Governance



Large AI applications rarely rely on a single model.



Typical workflows include:



\* Planning

\* Information retrieval

\* Tool execution

\* Validation

\* Report generation

\* Human approval

\* Final execution



Each agent performs a different responsibility, but the organization still owns one business decision.



Parmana governs the entire workflow rather than each agent independently.

\# Multi-Agent Execution Trust Chain

Authority

&#x20;     │

Authorization

&#x20;     │

Business Intent

&#x20;     │

PolicyReference

&#x20;     │

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

Planner Agent

&#x20;     │

Research Agent

&#x20;     │

Execution Agent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     │

Execution Trust Record

```



Every participating agent contributes evidence to the same immutable trust chain.



\---



\# Example Scenario



A customer support platform receives a request.



Three AI agents collaborate:



1\. Planner Agent creates a workflow.

2\. Research Agent retrieves customer history.

3\. Execution Agent prepares the response.



Parmana governs the workflow as one Business Transaction.



\---



\# Authority



Authority identifies the organization responsible for the workflow.



Example:



```typescript id="m1bknr"

const authority = {

&#x20;   authorityId: "authority-001",

&#x20;   authorityName: "Acme AI Operations"

};

```



Authority establishes organizational ownership.



\---



\# Authorization



Authorization grants permission to execute coordinated AI workflows.



Example:



```typescript id="m83t9n"

permissions: \[

&#x20;   "EXECUTE\_MULTI\_AGENT\_WORKFLOW"

]

```



Authorization defines what the agent platform may do.



\---



\# Business Intent



Intent records the requested business objective.



Example:



```typescript id="4k3txk"

operation:

&#x20;   "HANDLE\_CUSTOMER\_REQUEST"



target:

&#x20;   "customer-1001"

```



Intent belongs to the overall workflow—not to any individual agent.



\---



\# Policy Reference



Every workflow specifies exactly one policy.



Example:



```typescript id="3f7zyv"

policyName:

&#x20;   "multi-agent-governance-policy"



policyVersion:

&#x20;   "1.0.0"

```



Every participating agent operates under the same governing policy.



\---



\# Participating Agents



In this example three specialized agents contribute.



\### Planner Agent



Responsible for:



\* Workflow planning

\* Task sequencing

\* Dependency analysis



Example output:



```text id="pm7v0x"

Workflow generated

```



\---



\### Research Agent



Responsible for:



\* Retrieving customer history

\* Collecting supporting information

\* Preparing execution context



Example output:



```text id="h0fqyj"

Customer history retrieved

```



\---



\### Execution Agent



Responsible for:



\* Producing the final business action

\* Preparing the customer response

\* Completing execution



Example output:



```text id="rjlwmr"

Support response prepared

```



\---



\# Runtime Signals



Policy evaluation considers recorded runtime signals.



Example:



```typescript id="if4e7h"

signals: {



&#x20;   plannerCompleted: true,



&#x20;   researchCompleted: true,



&#x20;   executionCompleted: true,



&#x20;   safetyChecksPassed: true,



&#x20;   confidence: 0.97



}

```



These signals become part of deterministic replay.



\---



\# Decision



The Runtime evaluates the shared policy.



Example:



```text id="4gyotn"

Decision



APPROVED

```



The Decision records:



\* Outcome

\* Reason

\* Runtime signals

\* Policy version

\* Evaluation timestamp



The decision governs the entire workflow rather than an individual agent.



\---



\# Execution Evidence



Execution Evidence records each participating agent.



Example:



```typescript id="mrrjlwm"

{



&#x20;   planner: {



&#x20;       agent: "PlannerAgent",



&#x20;       result:

&#x20;           "Workflow generated"



&#x20;   },



&#x20;   research: {



&#x20;       agent: "ResearchAgent",



&#x20;       result:

&#x20;           "Customer history retrieved"



&#x20;   },



&#x20;   execution: {



&#x20;       agent: "ExecutionAgent",



&#x20;       result:

&#x20;           "Support response prepared"



&#x20;   }



}

```



Evidence preserves the contribution of every agent.



\---



\# Receipt



Successful execution produces a cryptographic Receipt.



Example:



```text id="rm3rwb"

Receipt ID



receipt-001



Algorithm



Ed25519

```



The receipt proves that the governed workflow completed successfully.



\---



\# Execution Trust Record



Every workflow artifact becomes part of the immutable Execution Trust Record.



```text id="tt9nka"

Business Transaction



Decision



Execution



Evidence



Receipt



Verification



Replay

```



This single record represents the authoritative history of the coordinated AI workflow.



\---



\# Replay



Replay reconstructs the original workflow.



Replay restores:



\* Original Business Transaction

\* Original PolicyReference

\* Original runtime signals

\* Original agent outputs

\* Original decision



Replay never invokes current AI models.



Historical replay uses the recorded execution artifacts.



\---



\# Verification



Verification confirms:



\* Trust Record integrity

\* Receipt integrity

\* Hash consistency

\* Artifact consistency



Verification demonstrates that the recorded workflow remains authentic.



\---



\# Auditing



An auditor can later determine:



\* Which organization initiated the workflow

\* Which policy governed execution

\* Which agents participated

\* Which runtime signals existed

\* Which decision was produced

\* Which evidence each agent generated

\* Whether execution completed successfully



The complete workflow becomes independently explainable.



\---



\# Benefits



Execution governance provides:



\* Cross-agent accountability

\* Explainable AI workflows

\* Deterministic replay

\* Independent verification

\* Regulatory evidence

\* Enterprise auditability



Parmana governs the execution of coordinated AI systems without dictating how the agents collaborate internally.

for the complete TypeScript implementation.



\---



\# Architectural Principles



Multi-agent governance follows the same Parmana architecture used across every domain:



\* Explicit Authority

\* Explicit Authorization

\* Explicit Intent

\* Explicit PolicyReference

\* Deterministic Policy Evaluation

\* Shared BusinessTransaction

\* Immutable Decision

\* Recorded Agent Evidence

\* Independent Verification

\* Deterministic Replay



The number of AI agents may increase, but the trust architecture remains unchanged.



\---



\# Relationship to Other Examples



This example demonstrates that Parmana governs workflows rather than individual AI models.



| Example | Focus                     |

| ------- | ------------------------- |

| 06      | Autonomous Systems        |

| 07      | Clinical AI               |

| 08      | Financial Governance      |

| 10      | Explicit Policy Selection |



All domains use the same immutable Execution Trust Chain.



\---



\# Summary



In this guide you learned how Parmana governs coordinated AI systems by recording:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Business Intent

\* PolicyReference

\* Participating Agents

\* Runtime Signals

\* Decision

\* Execution

\* Agent Evidence

\* Receipt

\* Execution Trust Record



This architecture enables organizations to build sophisticated multi-agent systems while preserving transparency, determinism, replayability, and independent verification.
