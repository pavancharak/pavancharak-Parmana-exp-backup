\# Parmana TypeScript SDK



\## Overview



The Parmana TypeScript SDK enables JavaScript and TypeScript applications to interact with the Parmana Runtime.



Parmana is an \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\* that ensures AI systems execute only authorized business transactions under explicitly defined governance policies. Every execution produces an immutable trust chain that can be replayed, verified, and independently audited.



The SDK provides strongly typed domain models, a high-level client, and helper APIs for execution, verification, and replay.



\---



\# What is Parmana?



Modern AI systems make decisions that increasingly affect business operations, financial transactions, healthcare, autonomous systems, and critical infrastructure.



Organizations require more than accurate AI models—they require confidence that AI systems execute only what has been authorized and approved.



Parmana provides this confidence through a deterministic execution trust architecture.



Every governed execution records:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* Policy Reference

\* Decision

\* Execution

\* Execution Evidence

\* Verification

\* Receipt

\* Execution Trust Record



These artifacts collectively form the \*\*Execution Trust Chain\*\*.



\---



\# Features



The TypeScript SDK provides:



\* Strongly typed domain models

\* High-level `ParmanaClient`

\* Business Transaction execution

\* Execution Trust Record verification

\* Deterministic replay

\* TypeScript-first developer experience

\* Promise-based asynchronous API

\* Support for Node.js and modern TypeScript applications

\# Installation



Using npm:



```bash

npm install @parmana/typescript-sdk

```



Using pnpm:



```bash

pnpm add @parmana/typescript-sdk

```



Using yarn:



```bash

yarn add @parmana/typescript-sdk

```



\---



\# Requirements



\* Node.js 22+

\* TypeScript 5.9+

\* Parmana Runtime



\---



\# Quick Start



```typescript

import {

&#x20; ParmanaClient,

} from "@parmana/typescript-sdk";



const client = new ParmanaClient({

&#x20; endpoint: "http://localhost:8080",

});



const receipt = await client.execute(transaction);



console.log(receipt.receiptId);

```

\# Domain Model



The SDK mirrors the Parmana Trust Core.



\## Authority



Defines who owns the business authority.



\---



\## Authorization



Defines who or what may execute.



\---



\## Intent



Defines the requested business operation.



\---



\## PolicyReference



Identifies the exact governance policy.



\---



\## BusinessTransaction



The immutable business request submitted to Parmana.



\---



\## Decision



Records deterministic policy evaluation.



\---



\## Execution



Records what actually happened.



\---



\## Verification



Records independent verification.



\---



\## Receipt



Cryptographic proof of execution.



\---



\## ExecutionTrustRecord



Canonical immutable record representing the complete execution trust chain.



\---



\# ParmanaClient



The SDK revolves around `ParmanaClient`.



```typescript

const client = new ParmanaClient({

&#x20; endpoint: "http://localhost:8080",

});

```



The client exposes:



```typescript

await client.execute(transaction);



await client.verify(trustRecord);



await client.replay(trustRecord);



await client.health();



await client.version();

```

The SDK is intentionally lightweight. Business governance remains inside the Parmana Runtime.

\# Examples



The SDK includes ten complete examples.



| Example | Description           |

| ------- | --------------------- |

| 01      | Basic execution       |

| 02      | Verify receipt        |

| 03      | Replay execution      |

| 04      | Audit trust chain     |

| 05      | Human-in-the-loop     |

| 06      | Autonomous vehicle    |

| 07      | Medical AI            |

| 08      | Financial transaction |

| 09      | Multi-agent workflow  |

| 10      | Custom policy         |

\# Design Principles



The TypeScript SDK follows the same architectural principles as the Parmana Runtime:



\* Explicit policy selection

\* Deterministic execution

\* Immutable trust artifacts

\* Independent verification

\* Replayable execution

\* Strong typing

\* Minimal client API



\---



\# Relationship to the Runtime



The SDK is \*\*not\*\* the Runtime.



The Runtime:



\* Evaluates policies

\* Produces decisions

\* Records execution

\* Generates receipts

\* Produces verification artifacts



The SDK simply provides a convenient, type-safe interface for interacting with those capabilities.



\---



\# Development Status



Current SDK capabilities include:



\* Typed domain models

\* HTTP client

\* Execution API

\* Verification API

\* Replay API

\* Complete example applications

\* Comprehensive documentation



Future releases will expand support for authentication, streaming APIs, advanced runtime features, and additional developer tooling.
