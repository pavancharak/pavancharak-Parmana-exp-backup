\# Example 08 — Financial Transaction Governance



\## Overview



Modern financial institutions increasingly rely on Artificial Intelligence to assist with payment processing, fraud detection, sanctions screening, anti-money laundering (AML), credit decisions, and transaction monitoring.



While AI can improve efficiency and accuracy, financial organizations must also ensure that every AI-assisted transaction is:



\* Authorized

\* Governed by approved policies

\* Explainable

\* Replayable

\* Independently verifiable

\* Auditable



Parmana provides this capability through its \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\*, creating an immutable execution history for every governed financial transaction.



This guide demonstrates how financial workflows are modeled using the TypeScript SDK.



\---



\# Learning Objectives



After completing this guide you will understand:



\* Why financial AI requires execution governance

\* How payment approvals become Business Transactions

\* How risk signals influence policy evaluation

\* How execution evidence supports compliance

\* How financial workflows become replayable and auditable



\---



\# Why Financial AI Needs Governance



Financial systems routinely make high-impact decisions.



Examples include:



\* Payment approvals

\* Wire transfers

\* Fraud detection

\* AML screening

\* Sanctions compliance

\* Credit approvals

\* Loan underwriting

\* Insurance claims



Organizations must be able to explain every decision long after the transaction has completed.

```



Every stage contributes to an immutable governance record.



\---



\# Example Scenario



A payment engine receives a request to transfer funds to a supplier.



Before approving the transaction, Parmana evaluates the organization's financial policies using recorded risk signals.



The Runtime verifies:



\* Authorization

\* Payment amount

\* KYC status

\* AML results

\* Sanctions screening

\* Fraud score



Only after successful policy evaluation is the payment approved.



\---



\# Authority



Authority identifies the financial institution responsible for the transaction.



Example:



```typescript id="0dyq9i"

const authority = {

&#x20;   authorityId: "bank-001",

&#x20;   authorityName: "Acme National Bank"

};

```



Authority establishes organizational accountability.



\---



\# Authorization



Authorization grants permission to perform financial operations.



Example:



```typescript id="77m3zd"

permissions: \[

&#x20;   "APPROVE\_PAYMENT"

]

```



Authorization answers:



> Which financial operations may this system perform?



\---



\# Payment Intent



Intent defines the requested financial action.



Example:



```typescript id="quc62m"

operation: "APPROVE\_PAYMENT"



target: "SUPPLIER-ACME"

```



Intent records the requested business action.



\---



\# Policy Reference



Every Business Transaction specifies the exact financial policy to evaluate.



Example:



```typescript id="aqjlwm"

policyName:

&#x20;   "aml-fraud-policy"



policyVersion:

&#x20;   "1.0.0"

```



Policy selection is deterministic.



The Runtime never searches for or automatically selects policies.



\---



\# Risk Signals



Financial policy evaluation uses recorded runtime signals.



Example:



```typescript id="8bjlwm"

signals: {



&#x20;   amount: 25000,



&#x20;   currency: "USD",



&#x20;   kycVerified: true,



&#x20;   amlPassed: true,



&#x20;   sanctionsMatch: false,



&#x20;   fraudScore: 0.08



}

```



These signals represent the execution context used by the policy engine.



They become immutable evidence for replay and audit.



\---



\# Decision



The Runtime evaluates the financial policy.



Example:



```text id="2f7zcf"

Decision



APPROVED

```



The Decision records:



\* Outcome

\* Reason

\* Policy version

\* Runtime signals

\* Evaluation timestamp



This creates a transparent explanation for the approval.



\---



\# Execution



Execution records the actual financial operation.



Example:



```text id="b7m6to"

Status



COMPLETED

```



Execution documents what occurred after policy approval.



\---



\# Execution Evidence



Execution Evidence records application-specific financial results.



Example:



```typescript id="44v4mn"

{



&#x20;   paymentReference:

&#x20;       "PAY-2026-0001",



&#x20;   settlementStatus:

&#x20;       "SETTLED",



&#x20;   paymentNetwork:

&#x20;       "SWIFT",



&#x20;   settlementTime:

&#x20;       "2026-06-29T13:45:12Z"



}

```



Evidence may also include:



\* Transaction identifiers

\* Ledger references

\* Settlement confirmations

\* Clearing network information

\* Audit references



Parmana intentionally allows financial systems to define their own evidence structure.



\---



\# Receipt



Successful execution produces a cryptographic Receipt.



Example:



```text id="s8h67q"

Receipt ID



receipt-001



Algorithm



Ed25519

```



The Receipt provides independently verifiable proof of execution.



\---



\# Execution Trust Record



Every financial artifact becomes part of the immutable Execution Trust Record.



```text id="8nvf9m"

Business Transaction



Decision



Execution



Evidence



Receipt



Verification



Replay

```



The trust record becomes the canonical history of the transaction.



\---



\# Replay



Replay reconstructs the original payment approval.



Replay restores:



\* Original payment request

\* Original policy version

\* Original risk signals

\* Original decision



Replay never evaluates current fraud scores or current sanctions lists.



Historical replay always uses recorded execution evidence.



\---



\# Verification



Verification confirms:



\* Trust Record integrity

\* Receipt integrity

\* Hash consistency

\* Artifact consistency



Verification ensures that the financial record has not been altered.



\---



\# Auditing



Auditors can later determine:



\* Which institution authorized the payment

\* Which system executed it

\* Which policy version was evaluated

\* Which risk signals were considered

\* Which fraud score was recorded

\* Which execution evidence was generated

\* Whether the payment settled successfully



No external logs are required to reconstruct the execution.



\---



\# Compliance Benefits



Execution governance supports:



\* Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

\* Fraud investigation

\* Regulatory reporting

\* Payment audits

\* Financial controls

\* Internal governance

\* Independent assurance



Parmana governs execution without replacing existing banking systems.

\---



\# Architectural Principles



Financial execution governance follows the same Parmana architecture used across all domains:



\* Explicit Authority

\* Explicit Authorization

\* Explicit Intent

\* Explicit PolicyReference

\* Deterministic Policy Evaluation

\* Immutable Decision

\* Recorded Runtime Signals

\* Execution Evidence

\* Independent Verification

\* Deterministic Replay



The financial domain changes the business context—not the trust architecture.



\---



\# Relationship to Other Examples



The same execution trust model applies across regulated industries.



| Example | Domain                  |

| ------- | ----------------------- |

| 06      | Autonomous Vehicles     |

| 07      | Medical AI              |

| 09      | Multi-Agent AI          |

| 10      | Custom Policy Selection |



Each domain records different business data while preserving the same deterministic governance model.



\---



\# Summary

\* Bank Authority

\* Financial Authorization

\* Payment Intent
