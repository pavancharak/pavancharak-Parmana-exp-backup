\# Example 07 — Medical AI Governance



\## Overview



Artificial Intelligence is increasingly assisting physicians in diagnosis, treatment planning, medical imaging, triage, and clinical decision support.



While AI can improve healthcare outcomes, hospitals must also ensure that every AI-assisted action is:



\* Authorized

\* Governed by approved clinical policies

\* Explainable

\* Auditable

\* Replayable

\* Independently verifiable



Parmana provides this governance by recording an immutable \*\*Execution Trust Chain\*\* for every AI-assisted clinical workflow.



This guide demonstrates how healthcare organizations can use the TypeScript SDK to govern AI execution while preserving physician oversight.



\---



\# Learning Objectives



After completing this guide you will understand:



\* Why healthcare requires execution governance

\* How clinical decisions become Business Transactions

\* How policy evaluation supports clinical safety

\* How physician oversight integrates into the trust chain

\* How clinical workflows become replayable and auditable



\---



\# Why AI Governance Matters in Healthcare



Clinical AI should support healthcare professionals—not replace them.



Examples of AI-assisted workflows include:



\* Disease diagnosis

\* Medical image interpretation

\* Treatment recommendations

\* Drug interaction analysis

\* Emergency triage

\* Laboratory result interpretation

\* Risk prediction

\* Clinical documentation



Each recommendation should be explainable long after patient care has been completed.

\# Execution Trust Chain

&#x20;       │

```



Every stage contributes to the permanent governance record.



\---



\# Example Scenario



A physician requests an AI assessment for a patient with respiratory symptoms.



The AI system:



\* Reviews structured clinical data

\* Evaluates the approved clinical policy

\* Produces a recommendation

\* Waits for physician approval

\* Records the completed workflow



Parmana governs this execution from beginning to end.



\---



\# Authority



Authority identifies the healthcare organization responsible for the workflow.



Example:



```typescript

const authority = {

&#x20;   authorityId: "hospital-001",

&#x20;   authorityName: "City General Hospital"

};

```



Authority establishes organizational accountability.



\---



\# Authorization



Authorization identifies the AI system that is permitted to assist clinicians.



Example:



```typescript

permissions: \[

&#x20;   "CLINICAL\_DECISION\_SUPPORT"

]

```



Authorization answers:



> Which clinical operations may this AI perform?



\---



\# Medical Intent



Intent records the requested clinical operation.



Example:



```typescript

operation: "ASSESS\_PATIENT"



target: "patient-100234"

```



Intent represents the physician's request—not the AI's opinion.



\---



\# Clinical Policy



Every Business Transaction specifies an explicit policy.



Example:



```typescript

policyName:

&#x20;   "clinical-decision-policy"



policyVersion:

&#x20;   "1.0.0"

```



Policy selection is explicit.



The Runtime never searches for policies.



\---



\# Clinical Signals



Policy evaluation uses recorded clinical information.



Example:



```typescript

signals: {



&#x20;   patientAge: 64,



&#x20;   bloodPressure: "145/90",



&#x20;   heartRate: 96,



&#x20;   oxygenSaturation: 98,



&#x20;   allergyCheck: "CLEAR",



&#x20;   physicianAvailable: true



}

```



These signals represent the clinical context used during decision evaluation.



They become immutable replay evidence.



\---



\# Decision



The Runtime evaluates the clinical policy.



Example:



```text

Decision



APPROVED

```



The Decision records:



\* Outcome

\* Explanation

\* Runtime signals

\* Policy version

\* Evaluation timestamp



This creates a deterministic record of why the recommendation was produced.



\---



\# Physician Oversight



Clinical AI recommendations should typically remain subject to physician judgment.



Execution evidence may indicate:



```typescript

{



&#x20;   diagnosisSuggestion:

&#x20;       "Community Acquired Pneumonia",



&#x20;   confidence: 0.94,



&#x20;   physicianReviewRequired: true,



&#x20;   physicianApproved: true



}

```



Parmana records the physician's participation as part of the trust chain rather than replacing clinical responsibility.



\---



\# Execution



Execution records what actually occurred after policy approval.



Example:



```text

Status



COMPLETED

```



Execution answers:



> What happened?



Decision answers:



> What should happen?



\---



\# Execution Evidence



Execution Evidence records application-specific results.



Examples include:



\* Diagnostic recommendation

\* Confidence score

\* Physician approval

\* Generated report

\* Imaging reference

\* Treatment recommendation



Evidence remains intentionally application-defined.



\---



\# Receipt



Successful execution generates an immutable Receipt.



Example:



```text

Receipt ID



receipt-001



Algorithm



Ed25519

```



The receipt provides cryptographic evidence that the workflow completed successfully.



\---



\# Execution Trust Record



Every clinical artifact becomes part of the immutable Execution Trust Record.



```text

Business Transaction



Decision



Execution



Evidence



Receipt



Verification



Replay

```



This aggregate forms the authoritative history of the AI-assisted workflow.



\---



\# Replay



Replay reconstructs the original clinical execution.



Replay restores:



\* Recorded patient signals

\* Policy version

\* Decision context

\* Clinical recommendation



Replay never substitutes current patient information.



Historical replay always evaluates the original recorded evidence.



\---



\# Verification



Verification confirms:



\* Trust Record integrity

\* Clinical artifact consistency

\* Receipt validity

\* Trust hash correctness



Verification determines whether the historical record remains authentic.



\---



\# Auditing



Auditors can later determine:



\* Which hospital authorized the workflow

\* Which AI system participated

\* Which physician requested the assessment

\* Which policy version was evaluated

\* Which patient signals were considered

\* Which recommendation was produced

\* Whether physician review occurred

\* Which execution evidence was recorded



The complete clinical workflow becomes independently reviewable.



\---



\# Benefits



Execution governance provides:



\* Clinical accountability

\* Regulatory compliance

\* Explainable AI

\* Physician oversight

\* Medical auditability

\* Incident investigation

\* Reproducible clinical decisions



Parmana governs execution without replacing medical expertise.

Every stage becomes a permanent trust artifact.

\# Architectural Principles



Clinical AI governance follows the same Parmana architecture used across every domain:



\* Explicit Authority

\* Explicit Authorization

\* Explicit Intent

\* Explicit PolicyReference

\* Deterministic Policy Evaluation

\* Immutable Decision

\* Recorded Clinical Signals

\* Execution Evidence

\* Independent Verification

\* Deterministic Replay



The healthcare domain changes the business context—not the trust architecture.



\---



\# Relationship to Other Examples



The same governance model extends naturally to other regulated domains.



| Example | Domain                  |

| ------- | ----------------------- |

| 06      | Autonomous Vehicles     |

| 08      | Financial Transactions  |

| 09      | Multi-Agent AI          |

| 10      | Custom Policy Selection |



Parmana applies the same execution trust principles regardless of industry.



\---
