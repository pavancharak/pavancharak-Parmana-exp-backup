\# Example 10 — Custom Policy Selection



\## Overview



One of Parmana's core architectural principles is that \*\*policy selection is explicit\*\*.



A Business Transaction always specifies the exact `PolicyReference` that governs execution.



The Runtime never:



\* Discovers policies

\* Searches for matching policies

\* Chooses the "best" policy

\* Applies the latest policy automatically



Instead, the Runtime loads \*\*exactly one\*\* policy identified by the `BusinessTransaction`.



This deterministic approach ensures that execution, replay, verification, and auditing always evaluate the same governance rules.



This guide demonstrates explicit policy selection using the TypeScript SDK.

\# Learning Objectives



After completing this guide you will understand:



\* Why policy selection is explicit

\* How `PolicyReference` participates in the trust chain

\* Why runtime policy discovery is prohibited

\* How deterministic replay depends on policy versions

\* How explicit policy references improve governance



\---



\# Why Explicit Policies?



Many policy engines automatically search for policies.



For example:



```text id="0utwji"

Find latest policy...



Find matching policy...



Apply newest version...

```



Although convenient, this approach creates uncertainty.



Questions become difficult to answer:



\* Which policy executed?

\* Which version produced the decision?

\* Can the decision be reproduced?

\* Will replay produce the same outcome?



Parmana eliminates this ambiguity through explicit policy selection.



\---



\# Execution Trust Chain



```text id="h61ndz"

Authority

&#x20;     │

Authorization

&#x20;     │

Intent

&#x20;     │

PolicyReference

&#x20;     │

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

Policy Evaluation

&#x20;     │

Decision

&#x20;     │

Execution

&#x20;     │

Receipt

&#x20;     │

Execution Trust Record

```



The `PolicyReference` is an immutable trust artifact.



\---



\# Example Scenario



A manufacturing system requests permission to start a production batch.



The request explicitly specifies:



```text id="pl7szp"

manufacturing-production-policy



Version 2.3.1

```



The Runtime loads that exact policy.



No discovery occurs.



\---



\# Creating the Policy Reference



```typescript id="k5zj4a"

const policy = {



&#x20;   policyName:

&#x20;       "manufacturing-production-policy",



&#x20;   policyVersion:

&#x20;       "2.3.1"



};

```



Both the policy name and version become part of the immutable Business Transaction.



\---



\# Business Transaction



The Business Transaction includes the selected policy.



```typescript id="bdh8v2"

const transaction = {



&#x20;   businessTransactionId:

&#x20;       "production-001",



&#x20;   authority,



&#x20;   authorization,



&#x20;   intent,



&#x20;   policy,



&#x20;   createdAt: new Date()



};

```



Policy selection occurs before execution begins.



\---



\# Runtime Responsibilities



When execution starts, the Runtime performs the following sequence:



```text id="m8x1qn"

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;       │

Read PolicyReference

&#x20;       │

Load Exact Policy

&#x20;       │

Evaluate

&#x20;       │

Produce Decision

```



Notice what does \*\*not\*\* happen:



\* No policy search

\* No policy ranking

\* No automatic upgrades

\* No implicit defaults



\---



\# Decision



The Decision records the policy that produced it.



Example:



```text id="6uuh8x"

Decision



APPROVED

```



The Decision references the same immutable `PolicyReference` contained in the Business Transaction.



\---



\# Runtime Signals



Policy evaluation uses the recorded runtime signals.



Example:



```typescript id="7c8lra"

signals: {



&#x20;   machineReady: true,



&#x20;   operatorCertified: true,



&#x20;   safetyInspectionPassed: true,



&#x20;   inventoryAvailable: true



}

```



Signals and policy together determine the decision.



\---



\# Execution



Execution records what occurred after policy approval.



Example:



```text id="7wz9hl"

Status



COMPLETED

```



Execution is governed by the selected policy—not by the Runtime.



\---



\# Execution Evidence



Execution Evidence records application-specific production details.



Example:



```typescript id="jv3j1w"

{



&#x20;   productionLine:

&#x20;       "LINE-3",



&#x20;   batch:

&#x20;       "BATCH-2026-001",



&#x20;   productionStarted: true



}

```



Evidence becomes part of the immutable execution history.



\---



\# Replay



Replay depends on explicit policy selection.



Replay sequence:



```text id="h4p7kt"

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;       │

Read PolicyReference

&#x20;       │

Load Version 2.3.1

&#x20;       │

Replay Signals

&#x20;       │

Replay Decision

```



Replay never evaluates version \*\*2.4.0\*\* simply because it exists.



Historical executions always use the original policy version.



\---



\# Verification



Verification confirms:



\* PolicyReference integrity

\* Decision consistency

\* Trust Record integrity

\* Receipt integrity

\* Hash consistency



Verification guarantees that the recorded policy has not been altered.



\---



\# Why Runtime Discovery Is Dangerous



Imagine that version \*\*3.0.0\*\* becomes available after execution.



If replay automatically selected the newest policy:



```text id="vqy4zh"

Original



Policy 2.3.1



Replay



Policy 3.0.0

```



The reproduced decision might differ from the historical decision.



Replay would no longer be deterministic.



Parmana prevents this by treating the policy version as part of the immutable trust chain.



\---



\# Architectural Principle



Policy selection belongs to the Business Transaction.



The Runtime's responsibility is limited to:



\* Loading the specified policy

\* Evaluating the specified policy

\* Recording the resulting decision



The Runtime never decides \*which\* policy should apply.



\---



\# Benefits



Explicit policy selection provides:



\* Deterministic execution

\* Deterministic replay

\* Independent verification

\* Historical reproducibility

\* Regulatory transparency

\* Version traceability

\* Explainable governance



\---



\# Complete Workflow



```text id="szz2f8"

Business Transaction

&#x20;       │

PolicyReference

&#x20;       │

Load Exact Version

&#x20;       │

Evaluate

&#x20;       │

Decision

&#x20;       │

Execution

&#x20;       │

Receipt

&#x20;       │

Verification

&#x20;       │

Replay

&#x20;       │

Audit

```



Every stage preserves the selected policy version.

\# Relationship to the Parmana Architecture



This example illustrates one of Parmana's foundational architectural guarantees:



\* \*\*BusinessTransaction specifies the `PolicyReference`.\*\*

\* \*\*The Runtime loads exactly one policy.\*\*

\* \*\*Policy discovery is never performed at runtime.\*\*

\* \*\*Replay always evaluates the recorded policy version.\*\*



These guarantees make execution reproducible across time and environments.



\---



\# Summary



In this guide you learned:



\* Why policy selection is explicit

\* How `PolicyReference` becomes part of the trust chain

\* Why runtime policy discovery is prohibited

\* How replay depends on policy versioning

\* How explicit policy references improve governance and auditability



Explicit policy selection is fundamental to Parmana's Execution Trust Infrastructure because it ensures there is never any ambiguity about \*\*which governance rules authorized an execution\*\*.



\---



\# Congratulations



You have completed all ten TypeScript SDK examples.



You now understand how Parmana governs AI execution through:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* PolicyReference

\* BusinessTransaction

\* Decision

\* Execution

\* Execution Evidence

\* Human Overrides

\* Receipts

\* Verification

\* Replay

\* Execution Trust Records



These concepts form the foundation of Parmana's \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\*, enabling AI systems to execute only what has been authorized, under explicitly selected policies, with every execution remaining deterministic, replayable, independently verifiable, and fully auditable.
