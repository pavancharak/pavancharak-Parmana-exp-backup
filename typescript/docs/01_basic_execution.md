\# Example 01 — Basic Execution



\## Overview



This example demonstrates the simplest end-to-end interaction with the Parmana Runtime using the TypeScript SDK.



By the end of this guide you will understand:



\* Creating the core trust-chain objects

\* Constructing a `BusinessTransaction`

\* Executing the transaction

\* Receiving an execution receipt

\* Understanding the resulting Execution Trust Chain



This example is the foundation for every subsequent example in the SDK.



\---



\# Learning Objectives



After completing this example you will understand:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* PolicyReference

\* BusinessTransaction

\* Receipt

\* ParmanaClient



Later examples build upon these concepts.



\---



\# Prerequisites



\* Node.js 22+

\* TypeScript SDK installed

\* Parmana Runtime running locally



```bash

npm install @parmana/typescript-sdk

```



\---



\# The Execution Trust Chain



Every execution begins with a Business Transaction.



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

Authorization

&#x20;     │

Intent

&#x20;     │

PolicyReference

&#x20;     │

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

Parmana Runtime

&#x20;     │

Decision

&#x20;     │

Execution

&#x20;     │

Receipt

```



This sequence is deterministic.



Every artifact becomes part of the trust chain.



\---



\# Step 1 — Create the Client



```typescript

import { ParmanaClient } from "@parmana/typescript-sdk";



const client = new ParmanaClient({

&#x20;   endpoint: "http://localhost:8080"

});

```



The client communicates with the Parmana Runtime.



\---



\# Step 2 — Create an Authority



Authority represents the business authority responsible for the transaction.



```typescript

const authority = {

&#x20;   authorityId: "authority-001",

&#x20;   authorityName: "Acme Corporation",

&#x20;   createdAt: new Date()

};

```



Authority defines \*\*who owns the decision-making authority\*\*.



\---



\# Step 3 — Create an Authorization



Authorization grants permission to execute.



```typescript

const authorization = {

&#x20;   authorizationId: "authorization-001",

&#x20;   authorityId: authority.authorityId,

&#x20;   subject: "warehouse-robot-01",

&#x20;   permissions: \[

&#x20;       "MOVE\_PALLET"

&#x20;   ],

&#x20;   issuedAt: new Date(),

&#x20;   expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000)

};

```



Authorization answers:



> Who is allowed to execute?



\---



\# Step 4 — Create an Intent



Intent describes the requested business operation.



```typescript

const intent = {

&#x20;   intentId: "intent-001",

&#x20;   authorizationId: authorization.authorizationId,

&#x20;   operation: "MOVE\_PALLET",

&#x20;   target: "Loading Bay 3",

&#x20;   createdAt: new Date()

};

```



Intent answers:



> What should happen?



\---



\# Step 5 — Select a Policy



Every Business Transaction specifies exactly one policy.



```typescript

const policy = {

&#x20;   policyName: "warehouse-policy",

&#x20;   policyVersion: "1.0.0"

};

```



This explicit policy reference becomes part of the immutable trust chain.



The Runtime never searches for policies.



\---



\# Step 6 — Build the Business Transaction



```typescript

const transaction = {

&#x20;   businessTransactionId: "txn-001",

&#x20;   authority,

&#x20;   authorization,

&#x20;   intent,

&#x20;   policy,

&#x20;   createdAt: new Date()

};

```



This object becomes the canonical request submitted to Parmana.



\---



\# Step 7 — Execute



```typescript

const receipt =

&#x20;   await client.execute(transaction);

```



The Runtime performs:



1\. Trust validation

2\. Policy evaluation

3\. Decision creation

4\. Execution recording

5\. Receipt generation



\---



\# Receipt



The returned Receipt contains:



```typescript

console.log(receipt.receiptId);



console.log(receipt.receiptHash);



console.log(receipt.algorithm);

```



Example:



```text

Receipt ID



receipt-001



Algorithm

Issued

```



\---



\# What Happened Internally?



Although the SDK exposes a single method:



```typescript

await client.execute(transaction);

```



The Runtime performs multiple deterministic operations.



```text

Business Transaction

&#x20;       │

Validate

&#x20;       │

Load Policy

&#x20;       │

Evaluate

&#x20;       │

Create Decision

&#x20;       │

Execute

&#x20;       │

Collect Evidence

&#x20;       │

Generate Receipt

```



\---



\# Why Use a Business Transaction?



Instead of sending loose parameters, Parmana requires a structured Business Transaction.



Advantages:



\* Explicit authority

\* Explicit authorization

\* Explicit intent

\* Explicit policy

\* Deterministic replay

\* Independent verification



\---



\# Error Handling



Always wrap execution in a try/catch block.



```typescript

try {



&#x20;   const receipt =

&#x20;       await client.execute(transaction);



}

catch(error){



&#x20;   console.error(error);



}

```



Production applications should log failures and handle retries according to their operational requirements.



\---



\# Architectural Principles



This example demonstrates several core Parmana principles.



\## Explicit Authority



Authority is always identified.



\---



\## Explicit Authorization



Execution permission is explicit.



\---



\## Explicit Intent



Intent is immutable.



\---



\## Explicit Policy



Exactly one PolicyReference is provided.



\---



\## Deterministic Runtime



The Runtime evaluates the supplied policy.



It does not discover or choose one automatically.



\---
