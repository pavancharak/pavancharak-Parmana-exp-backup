/**
 * Parmana TypeScript SDK
 *
 * SDK version, read from this package's own package.json at runtime so
 * it can never drift from the published version. Works both from source
 * (src/version.ts, package.json one directory up) and from the compiled
 * dist/ output (dist/version.js, package.json still one directory up —
 * npm always includes package.json in the published tarball regardless
 * of the "files" field).
