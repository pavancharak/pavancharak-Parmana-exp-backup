/**
 * Raised when the Runtime returns HTTP 403 for a caller that is
 * authenticated but not permitted to do the specific thing it asked
 * for. Covers two distinct denials, both intentionally collapsed to
 * this one SDK error class since both share the same "who you are is
 * known; you can't do this" shape — distinguish them via `serverCode`/
 * `message` if needed, not via `instanceof`:
 * - a caller asserting an authority.principalId it isn't permitted to
 *   assert (isPrincipalAllowed, packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts and
 *   transactions.ts) — carries no `code` field of its own.
 * - a caller invoking a capability (intent.action) it isn't permitted
 *   to invoke (isCapabilityAllowed.ts) — carries
 *   `code: "CAPABILITY_NOT_ALLOWED"`, preserved on `serverCode` below.
 * Distinct from AuthenticationError (401, no valid credential at all).
