# Parmana Governance

## Execution Trust Governance Model

**Version:** v1.0

---

# Purpose

Parmana establishes governance over computational execution.

Its purpose is not simply to authorize actions, but to ensure that every execution can be independently verified against the authority and intent that produced it.

Governance in Parmana is evidence-driven.

Every governance decision produces immutable trust artifacts.

---

# Governance Philosophy

Traditional governance answers:

* Who approved?
* When was it approved?

Execution authorization answers:

* Who authorized execution?
* What exactly was intended?
* Which policy applied?
* What decision was produced?
* What actually executed?
* Was execution compliant?
* Can this be independently verified?

Parmana governs execution rather than approval alone.

# Governance Chain

```text

        │
        ▼
Intent
        │
        ▼
Policy
        │
        ▼
Decision
        │
        ▼
Business Transaction
        │
        ▼

        ▼

        │

Execution Trust Record
```

Every artifact extends the trust chain.

Nothing is overwritten.

Everything is additive.

# Governance Layers

## Layer 1 — Authority

Authority defines who is permitted to initiate execution.

Examples include:

* Human operators
* Enterprise applications
* Service accounts
* Autonomous agents acting under delegated authority

Authority answers:

> Who is allowed to initiate execution?

---

## Layer 2 — Intent

Intent defines what should happen.

Intent exists before execution.

Intent is immutable.

Execution is evaluated against intent.

---

## Layer 3 — Policy

Policy defines the governing business rules.

Policies are versioned.

Policy versions never change.

Historical execution always references the exact policy version used.

---

## Layer 4 — Decision

A Decision records the outcome of policy evaluation.

Typical outcomes include:

* Approved
* Rejected

Every Decision references the Policy that produced it.

---

## Layer 5 — Business Transaction

A Business Transaction represents the accepted business request.

It becomes the root identifier for the complete trust chain.

Every downstream artifact references the originating Business Transaction.

---

## Layer 6 — Execution

Execution records what actually happened.

Execution evidence is immutable.

Multiple executions may exist for the same Business Transaction if retries or recovery are required.

Historical executions are never deleted.

---

## Layer 7 — Verification

Verification determines whether execution matched approved intent.

Verification evaluates:

* Structural integrity
* Policy consistency
* Execution completeness
* Evidence integrity

Verification never modifies execution.

It only produces additional evidence.

---

## Layer 8 — Receipt

Receipts provide cryptographic attestation.

Receipts prove that verification completed successfully.

Receipts contain:

* Trust Record hash
* Receipt hash
* Signature
* Algorithm identifier
* Timestamp

---

## Layer 9 — Execution Trust Record

The Execution Trust Record aggregates all immutable artifacts.

It represents the complete evidence package for a Business Transaction.

It is the primary object used for:

* Audit
* Compliance
* Investigation
* Replay
* Independent verification

# Governance Principles

## Immutability

Trust artifacts are never modified.

Corrections are represented by new artifacts.

---

## Determinism

The same inputs should produce the same governance outcome.

---

## Traceability

Every artifact references its predecessor.

Nothing exists in isolation.

---

## Evidence First

Governance is based on evidence rather than assumptions.

---

## Independent Verification

Third parties should be able to verify trust artifacts without trusting Parmana itself.

---

# Audit Model

Every Business Transaction produces a complete audit trail.

```text
Business Transaction
        │
        ▼
Decision
        │
        ▼
Execution
        │
        ▼
Verification
        │
        ▼
Receipt
        │
        ▼
Execution Trust Record
```

Audit records are append-only.

Historical evidence is preserved.

---

# Future Governance

The governance model is execution-engine independent.

The same governance principles apply to:

* Enterprise software
* Cloud services
* AI systems
* AI agents
* Multi-agent systems
* Robotics
* Distributed systems
* Edge computing
* Future quantum computing platforms

Execution technology may evolve.

Governance remains stable.

# Closing Statement

Parmana governs computational execution by establishing an immutable trust chain between authority, intent, policy, execution, verification, and evidence.

The objective is not simply to automate execution, but to ensure that every execution can be independently understood, audited, and verified.
