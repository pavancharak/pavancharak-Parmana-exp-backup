\# Parmana Reference Implementation



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Active



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the official reference implementation of the Parmana Specification.



The reference implementation demonstrates one correct implementation of the specification.



It is not the specification itself.



Other implementations MAY differ internally while remaining conformant.



\---



\# Principles



The reference implementation SHALL:



\* Conform to the Parmana Specification.

\* Preserve all Platform Guarantees.

\* Preserve all accepted ADRs.

\* Serve as executable documentation.



The implementation is intended to demonstrate correctness rather than maximize performance.



\---



\# Repository Structure



```text

packages/



core/

runtime/

verification/

crypto/

storage/

sdk/

api/

cli/

```



Each package corresponds to a logical component defined by the specification.



\---



\# Package Responsibilities



\## @parmana/core



Defines:



\* Value Objects

\* Domain Objects

\* Aggregate Roots

\* Shared Types



Contains no infrastructure code.



\---



\## @parmana/runtime



Responsible for:



\* Runtime orchestration

\* Runtime pipeline

\* Execution stages



Produces immutable `ExecutionTransaction` instances.



\---



\## Verification



Verification is not a separate package. It lives in
`packages/runtime/src/services/verification-service.ts` and runs on the
live execution path (`ExecutionTrustApplication.execute()` /
`POST /verify`), checking:



\* Integrity — recomputed trust-record hash matches the stored hash

\* Signature — cryptographic signature verifies against the stored key

\* Authorization binding — every APPROVED execution carries an authorizationId



A separate six-stage `@parmana/verification` pipeline package (Authority /
Authorization / Intent / Evidence / Signature stages) previously existed as
unwired scaffolding — no real implementation, no real test coverage — and
was retired in Session 5. Authority, Intent, and Evidence checks remain
unimplemented; see docs/CLAIMS.md's Future Claims.



\---



\## @parmana/crypto



Responsible for:



\* Hash providers

\* Signature providers

\* Integrity verification



Contains no business logic.



\---



\## @parmana/storage



Responsible for:



\* Repository interfaces

\* Persistence

\* Serialization



Storage remains replaceable.



\---



\## @parmana/sdk



Provides:



\* Public APIs

\* Builders

\* Developer utilities



Hides internal implementation details.



\---



\## @parmana/api



Provides HTTP access.



Responsibilities include:



\* Request validation

\* Routing

\* Response serialization



Delegates execution to the Runtime.



\---



\## @parmana/cli



Provides command-line tooling.



Capabilities include:



\* Execute

\* Verify

\* Replay

\* Inspect

\* Export



\---



\# Package Dependencies



Dependencies flow inward.

Core

```



Core has no dependency on higher-level packages.



\---



\# Testing Strategy



Each package SHALL include:



\* Unit tests

\* Integration tests (where applicable)

\* Conformance tests

\* Documentation examples



\---



\# Reference Quality



The reference implementation prioritizes:



1\. Correctness

2\. Readability

3\. Determinism

4\. Testability

5\. Maintainability



Performance optimizations SHALL NOT compromise platform guarantees.



\---



\# Conformance



The reference implementation is considered conformant when:



\* All specifications are implemented.

\* All ADRs are preserved.

\* Conformance tests pass.

\* Platform guarantees remain satisfied.



\---



\# Future Implementations



Alternative implementations MAY:



\* Use different programming languages.

\* Use different databases.

\* Use different runtime environments.

\* Use different cryptographic providers.



Alternative implementations SHALL preserve the externally observable behavior defined by the Parmana Specification.



\---



\# Summary



The reference implementation serves as the canonical executable realization of the Parmana Specification.



It demonstrates how Execution Trust can be achieved through deterministic execution, immutable domain models, append-only evidence, independent verification, and cryptographic integrity while remaining implementation independent.
