/**
 * redocly bundle carries each source JSON Schema file's own top-level
 * $id/$schema straight into components.schemas.<name> unchanged. Under
 * OAS 3.1 / JSON Schema 2020-12, a $id on a schema establishes a new
 * base URI for resolving $refs found within (or pointing at) that
 * schema, so a strict resolver — Swagger UI's, in this case, though not
 * redocly's own lint — rebases every #/components/schemas/... pointer
 * inside (or targeting) an $id-bearing schema against that schema's
 * https://schemas.parmana.ai/... $id instead of the bundle's own root,
 * and fails to resolve it ("Invalid object key 'components' at position
 * 0"). The source schema files under schemas/ keep their $id/$schema —
 * they're valid, independently-resolvable JSON Schema documents on
 * their own. Only this bundled OAS document, where every schema lives
 * under one shared #/components/schemas root, needs them gone.
