    Responsibilities

        Verify a Refusal Record's signature.

        Maps to POST /refusal/verify -- takes the record itself, not a
        lookup by id. No caller authentication is required by this
        route: it is the capability that makes a refusal independently
        third-party verifiable (RFC-0021).

        Parameters
        ----------
        record:
            The Refusal Record to verify.

        Returns
        -------
        True if the signature is valid, False otherwise.
