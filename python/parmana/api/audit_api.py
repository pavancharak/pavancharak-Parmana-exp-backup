    Audit Event API.

    Responsibilities
    ----------------
    - Verify a signed caller-authentication audit event's signature

    This API does NOT:
    - execute Business Transactions
    - look up an audit event by id -- there is no such lookup route;
      verification takes the event and its stored signature directly.

        Verify a signed audit event's signature.

        Maps to POST /audit/verify. Takes the event (a CallerAuditEvent,
        as recorded by the Runtime's audit sinks) and its stored
        signature directly, not a lookup by id.
        No caller authentication is required by this route -- the same
        independent, third-party verifiability as
        RefusalApi.verify().

        Parameters
        ----------
        event:
            The signed audit event, exactly as recorded (`type`,
            `occurredAt`, `route`, plus event-specific fields). Left as
            a generic dict, like the Runtime route itself
            (packages/api/src/routes/audit-verify.ts): the two event
            shapes this can verify diverge on every field past those
            three, and verification operates on canonical bytes over
            whatever object was actually signed, not a fixed schema.

        signature:
            The signature stored alongside the event.

        Returns
        -------
        True if the signature is valid, False otherwise.
