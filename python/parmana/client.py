            fail-fast check.

        Parameters
        ----------
        endpoint:
            Base URL of the Parmana Runtime.

        api_key:
            Caller bearer key, minted by scripts/generate-api-key.ts. Sent
            as `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` on every request. Omit
            only against a Runtime started with PARMANA_AUTH_DISABLED=true
            (local development only); every other deployment rejects an
            unauthenticated request with a 401 before a Business
            Transaction is even constructed. See
            /api-reference/authentication.

        timeout:
            HTTP timeout in seconds, applied per request.

        max_retries:
            Retry attempts for idempotent (GET) requests that fail with
            a connection error or a 502/503/504 response. POST requests
            (execute, verify, receipt, replay) are never retried.

        backoff_factor:
            Exponential backoff factor between retries, in seconds.

        debug:
            Enable request/response debug logging on the "parmana" logger.
