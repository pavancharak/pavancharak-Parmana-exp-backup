    Constructs the specific ParmanaHttpError subclass for a response.

    Classification is primarily by HTTP status, with `code` used to

    - `code: "POLICY_DENIED"` -- a policy REJECTED decision, mapped to
      ExecutionRejectedError, checked first since it needs a wholly
      different SDK exception.
    - `code: "CAPABILITY_NOT_ALLOWED"` -- a caller invoking a capability
      it isn't permitted to invoke (isCapabilityAllowed.ts). Checked
      explicitly (not left to fall through the generic status-map lookup
      below) so its `code` is preserved on AuthorizationError.server_code
      instead of being silently dropped.
    - no `code` at all -- a caller asserting an authority.principalId it
      isn't permitted to assert (isPrincipalAllowed.ts,
      packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts and transactions.ts). Also maps
      to AuthorizationError, via the generic status-map lookup below.

    429 (rate limited) is handled ahead of the generic map too, since it
    needs to thread `retry_after_seconds` through to RateLimitError --
    mirrors typescript/src/transport/mapHttpErrorResponse.ts's identical,
