Verify.

Submits a Business Transaction, then demonstrates both Verification
entry points:

- `client.verification.verify(...)`      -> POST /verify   (fresh)
- `client.verification.get_latest(...)`  -> GET /verification/:id (cached)

See README.md in this directory for prerequisites and expected output.
