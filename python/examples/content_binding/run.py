"""
Content binding (from the client's perspective).

Submits a Business Transaction, then attempts to resubmit a MODIFIED
transaction under the same businessTransactionId, and reports exactly
what the Runtime does about it.

IMPORTANT -- read README.md in this directory before drawing conclusions
from the output. What this example observes is Business Transaction ID
uniqueness, NOT cryptographic content-binding (verifying a
SignedExecutionAuthorization's businessTransactionHash against the
actual submitted content). The plain local API server does not perform
that check; see the README for why and what would be required.
