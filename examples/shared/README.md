\# Shared Assets



\## Overview



This directory contains reusable assets shared across the Parmana tutorials and scenarios.



Unlike the tutorials and scenarios, these files are not intended to demonstrate a specific capability. Instead, they provide common helper functions, reference policies, and sample business transactions that reduce duplication across examples.

\# Helpers



The \*\*helpers\*\* directory contains small utility functions used by multiple examples.



| File | Purpose |

|------|---------|

| `load-json.ts` | Reads and parses JSON files |

| `print.ts` | Pretty-prints objects to the console |

| `save-output.ts` | Writes example output to disk |



These helpers keep the tutorial code focused on Parmana concepts rather than file handling or console formatting.



\---



\# Policies



The \*\*policies\*\* directory contains reusable policy definitions used by examples.



Current contents:



\- `default-policy.json`



Tutorials may define their own policies, while scenarios typically reference the canonical policies under the repository's `policies/` directory.



\---



\# Transactions



The \*\*transactions\*\* directory contains reusable Business Transaction examples.



Current contents:



\- `vendor-payment.json`

\- `expense-approval.json`



These files provide common input data for examples and can also serve as templates when creating new scenarios.



\---



\# Design Principles



The shared directory follows three principles:



\- \*\*Reusable\*\* — Assets should be usable across multiple tutorials and scenarios.

\- \*\*Generic\*\* — Shared files should avoid scenario-specific behavior whenever possible.

\- \*\*Minimal\*\* — Only include files that are genuinely shared to keep the examples easy to understand.

\# Usage



Import helper utilities:



```ts

import { loadJson } from "../shared/helpers/load-json.js";

import { print } from "../shared/helpers/print.js";

```



Load a shared transaction:



```ts

const transaction = await loadJson(

&#x20; "../shared/transactions/vendor-payment.json",

);

```

\# Notes



The files in this directory are intended to support the examples.



For production applications, use the packages under the `packages/` directory (`@parmana/runtime`, `@parmana/policy`, `@parmana/crypto`, etc.) rather than relying on these helper utilities.
