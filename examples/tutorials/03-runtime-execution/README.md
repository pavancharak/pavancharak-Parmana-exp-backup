# \# Tutorial 03 — Runtime Execution

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# This tutorial executes a complete Business Transaction using the Parmana Runtime.

# 

# The Runtime loads the referenced policy, evaluates it, creates a decision, and produces an Execution Trust Record.

# 

# Verification and Receipt Generation are covered in later tutorials.
