\# Tutorial 46 — TOCTOU Protection



\## Overview



Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) is one of the most important security problems in distributed systems.



A request may be approved correctly, but modified before it is actually executed.



Parmana prevents this by verifying the executable content immediately before enterprise execution.

Execution Rejected

```



\---



\## Why This Matters



Approving a request is not enough.



The system must also verify that \*\*the request being executed is still the request that was approved\*\*.



Without this verification an attacker could modify:



\- payment amount

\- destination account

\- vendor

\- purchase order

\- contract

\- invoice

\- execution target



after authorization but before execution.

\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 46 - TOCTOU Protection

==================================================



✓ Policy evaluated.

✓ Execution Authorization generated.



Execution Gateway

\--------------------------------------------------



Authorized Hash : 4b7761f6...



Current Hash    : a91d87...



✓ TOCTOU attack detected.



Execution rejected before reaching the enterprise system.



Execution Governance Summary

\--------------------------------------------------



✓ Policy Evaluation

✓ Execution Authorization

✓ Authorization Binding

✓ Executable Content Verification

✓ Execution Gateway Protection

✓ Enterprise Execution Prevented



Parmana verifies what is about to execute,

not merely what was previously approved.

\## How Parmana Prevents TOCTOU



Immediately before execution the gateway:



1\. Reads the incoming request.

2\. Rebuilds the executable content.

3\. Recomputes the executable content hash.

4\. Compares it with the signed hash inside the Execution Authorization.

5\. Rejects execution if they differ.



This verification occurs \*\*at execution time\*\*, not only at decision time.

\## Series Complete



You have completed the Execution Governance tutorial series.



Across 46 tutorials you built a complete understanding of how Parmana ensures that AI-driven execution is:



\- authorized

\- authenticated

\- policy-bound

\- replay-resistant

\- tamper-resistant

\- time-valid

\- execution-bound

\- cryptographically verifiable



The fundamental principle is:



> \*\*Parmana verifies what is about to execute—not merely what was previously approved.\*\*
