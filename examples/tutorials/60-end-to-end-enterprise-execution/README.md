\# Tutorial 60 — End-to-End Enterprise Execution

\## Objective

In this tutorial, you'll run the complete Parmana chain in one pass — policy evaluation, signed authorization, Gateway envelope verification, request-bound attestation, session credential issuance, connector execution, credential destruction, an audit record, and a final trust record — over a single mock SAP invoice-posting transaction.

\## What You'll Learn

\* Evaluate a real policy with the PolicyEngine

\* Produce a signed Execution Authorization

\* Independently verify the Gateway envelope

\* Observe the request-bound Gateway attestation concept

\* Watch a session credential get issued, consumed, and destroyed inside a Secure Connector

\* Read the resulting audit record

\* Produce a hashed, signed trust record over the final outcome

==================================================

Tutorial 60 - End-to-End Enterprise Execution

==================================================



Stage 1 - Business Transaction

\--------------------------------------------------

Vendor  : VENDOR-1001

Amount  : 25000 USD

Action  : sap:post-invoice



Stage 2 - Policy Evaluation

\--------------------------------------------------

Outcome : APPROVE

Reason  : Amount within auto-approval threshold.



Stage 3 - Signed Authorization

\--------------------------------------------------

Authorization ID : b473d890-fa65-4a67-8631-a13090d158a6

Expires At       : 2026-07-11T08:58:25.785Z



Stage 4 - Gateway Envelope Verification

\--------------------------------------------------

Signature Verified          : true

Not Expired                 : true

Content Hash Matches        : true

Nonce Unseen                 : true



Stage 5 - Request-Bound Attestation

\--------------------------------------------------

Bound To Authorization : b473d890-fa65-4a67-8631-a13090d158a6

The production Gateway below mints an equivalent, fresh attestation internally, once per execute() call.



Stage 6-8 - Session Credential Issue, Connector Execution, Credential Destroyed

\--------------------------------------------------

Result : SUCCESS



Stage 9 - Audit Record

\--------------------------------------------------

Type          : execution.completed

Connector     : sap

Credential ID : 37a88802-012b-46ea-bbc3-de37281d2b53

Gateway ID    : gateway-1

Authorization : b473d890-fa65-4a67-8631-a13090d158a6

Occurred At   : 2026-07-11T08:57:25.790Z



Stage 10 - Trust Record

\--------------------------------------------------

Trust Record Hash      : 88969c3ac7ab6e5b9985881aab43693bb9d2ca16fd01bbe4d61630131b532bbd

Signature Algorithm    : ed25519

✓ Full chain complete: policy → authorization → envelope → attestation → session credential → connector → audit → trust record.

\## A Note On Keys

This tutorial generates two independent Ed25519 keypairs in memory with generateKeyPairSync, every run — one for the Runtime's authorization signature, one for the Gateway's attestation signature. Neither is read from or written to the repository's keys/ directory, and neither depends on PARMANA_GATEWAY_KEY_ID. That in-memory pattern is for this tutorial's zero-setup reproducibility only. A real deployment sources the Gateway's attestation key the same way it sources every other Parmana signing key: from disk, via FileKeyProvider, keyed by PARMANA_GATEWAY_KEY_ID (default "gateway") — see createGatewayKeyPair.ts. Production generates no keys automatically; you provision them once, ahead of time.

\---

\## Why This Matters

Each of the ten stages above closes a distinct gap: policy evaluation proves the action was permitted; the signed authorization proves the Runtime approved this exact content; envelope verification proves the request wasn't forged, tampered, expired, or replayed; the request-bound attestation proves the release itself came from the Gateway's key, for this authorization specifically; the session credential proves the enterprise secret was resolved exactly once, immediately before use, and nowhere else; the audit record and trust record together let anyone — not just Parmana — verify, after the fact, exactly what happened and why it was trusted.

\---

\## Next Steps

Tutorials 57–60 complete the Credential Isolation milestone: the AI caller, the Runtime, and the Gateway itself never hold an enterprise credential's secret value — only the Secure Connector does, for the shortest possible window, under a request-bound, cryptographically verified release.
