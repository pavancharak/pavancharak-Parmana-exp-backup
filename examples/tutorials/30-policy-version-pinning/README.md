\# Tutorial 30 — Policy Version Pinning



\## Overview



In the previous tutorials we learned how Parmana generates, verifies, and protects Execution Authorizations.



This tutorial demonstrates an equally important governance principle:



> \*\*A cryptographically valid authorization is not automatically executable.\*\*



Enterprise systems may require that an authorization was issued using a specific policy version.



If the authorization references an older policy version, execution is rejected even though the signature is valid.

\## Why Policy Version Pinning Exists



Policies evolve over time.



For example:



```text

vendor-payment



2.0.0

```



may later become



```text

vendor-payment



2.1.0

```



because:



\- approval thresholds changed

\- fraud controls were updated

\- compliance requirements changed

\- new business rules were introduced



An enterprise system may refuse to execute requests authorized under older policy versions.



\---



\## Cryptographic Verification



The authorization is first verified normally.



```ts

const verification =

&#x20; await verifier.verify(

&#x20;   authorization,

&#x20;   publicKey,

&#x20; );

```



If verification succeeds, enterprise governance continues.



\---



\## Enterprise Policy Check



The receiving system compares the expected policy version with the version contained inside the authorization.



```ts

const expectedPolicyVersion =

&#x20; "2.1.0";



const actualPolicyVersion =

&#x20; authorization.payload.policyVersion;

```



If the versions differ, execution is rejected.



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 30 - Policy Version Pinning

==================================================



Generating authorization...



✓ Authorization generated.



Verifying authorization...



✓ Authorization verified.



Enterprise Policy Check



Expected Policy : vendor-payment@2.1.0

Authorization   : vendor-payment@2.0.0



✗ Authorization rejected.

Reason: Policy version mismatch.



Tutorial completed successfully.

```



\---



\## Why This Is Important



Notice that the authorization is:



\- correctly signed

\- unmodified

\- not expired



Yet execution is still rejected.



This demonstrates the difference between:



\- \*\*Cryptographic validity\*\*

\- \*\*Enterprise governance\*\*



Both are required before execution proceeds.

\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/30-policy-version-pinning/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Next Tutorial



\*\*Tutorial 31 — Authorization Binding\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates how Parmana cryptographically binds an Execution Authorization to the exact Business Transaction it approved, preventing an authorization from being reused for a different request.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Authorization verification proves authenticity.

\- Enterprise systems may require additional governance checks.

\- Policy version pinning ensures execution uses approved policy versions.

\- Cryptographic verification and governance are complementary layers of protection.
