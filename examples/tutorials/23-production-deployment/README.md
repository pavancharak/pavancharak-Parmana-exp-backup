\# Tutorial 23 — Production Deployment



\## Overview



This tutorial demonstrates how to configure Parmana for a production environment.



Unlike previous tutorials that focus on Runtime behavior, this tutorial focuses on configuring the Runtime using persistent storage, policy repositories, and environment variables.



The same Runtime programming model is used in development and production.

\## Runtime Configuration



A production Runtime is configured using the same builder API used throughout the tutorial series.



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(

&#x20;     policyRepository,

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .build(

&#x20;     trustRecords,

&#x20;   );

```



The Runtime itself does not change between environments.



Only the supporting infrastructure changes.



\---



\## Policy Repository



Policies are loaded from the configured repository.



```ts

const policyRepository =

&#x20; new FilePolicyRepository(

&#x20;   "policies",

&#x20; );

```



In production, organizations typically version and review policies through their deployment process.



\---



\## Trust Record Repository



This tutorial uses a repository abstraction.



Development environments may use:



\- MemoryExecutionTrustRecordRepository



Production environments typically use a persistent implementation such as:



\- SupabaseExecutionTrustRecordRepository



The Runtime code remains unchanged.



\---



\## Environment Configuration



The included `.env.example` demonstrates typical production configuration.



Example settings include:



\- Storage backend

\- Policy directory

\- Authorization TTL

\- Logging

\- Runtime environment



Environment-specific values should never be committed with secrets.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/23-production-deployment/run.ts

```



or execute the full tutorial suite:



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Expected Output



```text

\## Production Checklist



Before deploying Parmana, verify:



\- Policy repository is configured.

\- Persistent storage is configured.

\- Environment variables are loaded.

\- Secrets are stored securely.

\- Authorization TTL is configured appropriately.

\- Logging is enabled.

\- Production policies have been reviewed.



\---



\## Design Principles



Parmana separates Runtime behavior from deployment configuration.



This provides several advantages:



\- The same Runtime code runs in every environment.

\- Storage implementations can be replaced without changing business logic.

\- Policies remain independently versioned.

\- Infrastructure concerns remain outside the Runtime.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned how to:



\- Configure a Runtime for production use.

\- Configure policy and storage repositories.

\- Use environment variables for deployment.

\- Separate Runtime behavior from deployment infrastructure.



This separation allows Parmana to move from local development to enterprise production deployments while preserving the same deterministic Runtime programming model.
