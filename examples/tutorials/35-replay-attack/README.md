\# Tutorial 35 — Replay Attack



\## Overview



A replay attack occurs when an attacker captures a valid Execution Authorization and attempts to submit the exact same authorization multiple times.



Without replay protection, a previously authorized action could execute repeatedly.



Parmana prevents replay attacks by requiring every Execution Authorization to contain a unique \*\*nonce\*\*. The receiving system records every accepted nonce and rejects any subsequent reuse.

```

\## How Replay Protection Works



Every Execution Authorization contains:



\- Authorization ID

\- Nonce

\- Signature

\- Expiration Time



When the gateway receives an authorization it:



1\. Verifies the signature.

2\. Verifies the authorization has not expired.

3\. Checks whether the nonce has already been accepted.

4\. Rejects duplicate nonces.



\---



\## First Request



The first request contains a previously unseen nonce.



```text

Nonce



8a5c...



↓



Accepted



↓



Nonce stored

```



\---



\## Replay Attempt



The identical authorization is submitted again.



```text

Nonce



8a5c...



↓



Already Seen



↓



Rejected

```



The authorization itself is still valid.



The rejection occurs because the nonce has already been consumed.

\## Expected Output

\## Why Replay Protection Matters



Replay protection prevents an attacker from executing the same approved action multiple times.



Examples include:



\- releasing the same payment twice

\- creating duplicate purchase orders

\- executing duplicate wire transfers

\- approving the same invoice repeatedly



\---



\## Security Layers



Replay protection is only one layer of execution trust.

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

The next tutorial demonstrates how modifying execution parameters changes the executable content hash and causes authorization verification to fail.

\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Every Execution Authorization contains a unique nonce.

\- The Execution Gateway records accepted nonces.

\- A nonce can only be used once.

\- Replay attacks are rejected before enterprise execution.
