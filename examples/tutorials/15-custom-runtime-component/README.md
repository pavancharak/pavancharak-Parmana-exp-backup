\# Tutorial 15 — Custom Runtime Component



This tutorial demonstrates how to extend the Parmana Runtime by implementing a custom \*\*Runtime Component\*\*.



Unlike the previous tutorial, which customized authorization logic through a Policy, this tutorial customizes the Runtime itself without modifying Parmana's core implementation.



\## What You Will Learn



\* Implement a custom `RuntimeComponent`.

\* Access the `RuntimeContext`.

\* Observe runtime execution.

\* Register custom components using `RuntimeBuilder`.

\* Execute the runtime with custom stages.



This demonstrates one of Parmana's core architectural principles:



> Runtime behavior is extensible through components, not by modifying the runtime engine.



\## Scenario



Many organizations need additional runtime behavior, including:



\* Logging

\* Metrics

\* Notifications

\* Distributed tracing

\* Security monitoring

\* Compliance checks



Rather than modifying Parmana's runtime, developers implement their own Runtime Components and register them in the Runtime Pipeline.



This tutorial implements a simple logging component.

```



\## Logging Component



The custom component observes the Runtime Context and prints:



\* Business Transaction ID

\* Policy

\* Action

\* Target



The Runtime Context is returned unchanged so the remaining runtime stages continue normally.



\## Registering the Component



The component is registered using the Runtime Builder.



```ts

new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20; .withPolicyRepository(policyRepository)

&#x20; .addStage(new LoggingRuntimeComponent())

&#x20; .build(...);

```



The Runtime Pipeline automatically executes the component during runtime execution.



\## Run



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/15-custom-runtime-component/run.ts

```



\## Expected Output



The example produces:



\* Logging Runtime Component output

\* Execution Trust Record

\* Verification

\* Receipt



\## Key Takeaway



Policies define \*\*what\*\* business actions are authorized.



Runtime Components define \*\*how\*\* the runtime behaves while processing authorized transactions.



By separating business authorization from runtime behavior, Parmana allows organizations to extend execution pipelines without modifying the runtime engine itself.
