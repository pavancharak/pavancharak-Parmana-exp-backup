\# Tutorial 59 — Secure Connectors

\## Objective

In this tutorial, you'll combine a signed Gateway attestation with a SessionCredentialSecureConnector: verifying attestation authenticity and request-binding, then walking through the connector's own enforcement — no genuine session, no execution — before a successful, fully-audited run whose session credential is destroyed immediately afterward.

\## What You'll Learn

\* Mint and verify a signed Gateway attestation, bound to one authorizationId

\* Confirm a spoofed (wrong-key) attestation is rejected

\* Confirm an attestation cannot be replayed against a different request

\* Confirm a SecureConnector rejects direct invocation without a genuine, Gateway-issued session

\* Execute successfully through policy, session, and credential checks

\* Confirm the session credential used is destroyed immediately after execution

SessionCredentialSecureConnector.execute()

issue() → consume() → executor.execute() → revoke()

==================================================



Gateway Attestation

\--------------------------------------------------

Gateway ID       : gateway-1

Authorization ID : 7c85d9b3-dd5f-4bfc-b601-1bc4b4c2f3ae

Nonce            : fdfd4e80-9d78-4151-bff2-ae07349ba4b1

Issued At        : 2026-07-11T08:53:00.640Z

✓ Authenticates for its own authorizationId: true



Spoofed Attestation Rejected

\--------------------------------------------------

✗ Accepted: false



Attestation Replayed Against A Different Request

\--------------------------------------------------

✗ Accepted for "authorization-999": false



Direct Invocation Without A Genuine Session

\--------------------------------------------------

✓ Rejected:

&#x20; Connector rejected invalid, expired, modified, or reused Gateway session.



Successful Execution

\--------------------------------------------------

Result: SUCCESS

Audit Record:

&#x20; type          : execution.completed

&#x20; connectorId   : sap

&#x20; credentialId  : b7802fbf-e63d-47e1-ba02-331422943388

&#x20; gatewayId     : gateway-1



Credential Destroyed After Execution

\--------------------------------------------------

✓ The session credential the connector used is already destroyed:

&#x20; Session credential has been revoked: b7802fbf-e63d-47e1-ba02-331422943388.

\## Why This Matters

A SecureConnector's own frozen attestation proves the connector was configured with material signed by the Gateway's key — it does not, by itself, prove any individual call originated from the Gateway, since the same value is reused for every execution the connector ever handles. That is why the connector's real protection against a forged or replayed call is the single-use, Gateway-issued GatewaySession, not the attestation alone — and why the audited credentialId can be used to prove, after the fact, that the exact session credential the connector consumed no longer resolves to anything.
