\# Tutorial 39 — Policy Substitution



\## Overview



Policy substitution is an attack where an attacker attempts to execute a request under a different policy than the one Parmana originally evaluated.



An Execution Authorization is valid \*\*only\*\* for the policy name and policy version that produced it.



Changing either value invalidates the authorization.

\## Attack Scenario



```text

Policy Evaluation



vendor-payment@2.0.0



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Authorization



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Attacker changes policy



vendor-payment@2.0.0

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

vendor-payment@3.0.0



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Gateway compares policy



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



✗ Policy Mismatch



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Rejected

```



\---



\## Authorized Policy



```text

Policy Name



vendor-payment



Version



2.0.0

```



\---



\## Modified Policy



```text

Policy Name



vendor-payment



Version



3.0.0

```



Only the policy version changed.



Even though the execution request is identical, the authorization is no longer valid.



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================



Authorized Policy



vendor-payment@2.0.0



Substituted Policy



vendor-payment@3.0.0



✓ Policy substitution detected.



Execution rejected.



Policy Integrity

\--------------------------------------------------



Authorizations are valid only for the policy

under which they were originally issued.



Tutorial completed successfully.

```



\---



\## Why Policy Integrity Matters



Enterprise policies evolve over time.



Examples include:



\- approval thresholds

\- segregation-of-duty rules

\- compliance requirements

\- risk scoring

\- regulatory controls



An authorization issued under one policy version must never be interpreted as approval under another.



\---



\## Gateway Validation



The Execution Gateway verifies that:



\- Policy name matches.

\- Policy version matches.

\- Authorization was issued for that policy.



Only then may execution continue.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/39-policy-substitution/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Next Tutorial



\*\*Tutorial 40 — Signature Forgery\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates why an attacker cannot fabricate an Execution Authorization without Parmana's private signing key.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Execution Authorizations are bound to the policy that approved them.

\- Changing the policy name or version invalidates the authorization.

\- The Execution Gateway detects policy mismatches.

\- Policy substitution is rejected before enterprise execution.
