\# Tutorial 32 — Execution Pipeline



\## Overview



So far we've explored individual parts of Parmana:



\- Policy Evaluation

\- Execution Authorization

\- Verification

\- Receipt Generation



This tutorial demonstrates how those components work together as a single execution pipeline.



The `ExecutionTrustApplication` orchestrates the complete lifecycle of a Business Transaction and produces an immutable Execution Trust Record.

\## Pipeline



```text

Business Transaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Accept Transaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Runtime

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verification

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Receipt

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Trust Record

```



Unlike previous tutorials that focused on individual components, this tutorial demonstrates the complete orchestration.

\## Building the Application



```ts

const application =

&#x20; new ExecutionTrustApplicationBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(

&#x20;     new FilePolicyRepository("policies"),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .build(

&#x20;     new MemoryExecutionTrustRecordRepository(),

&#x20;   );

```



The builder assembles the complete Execution Trust pipeline.



\---



\## Executing the Pipeline



```ts

const trustRecord =

&#x20; await application.execute(

&#x20;   transaction,

&#x20; );

```



The application performs the following stages automatically:



1\. Accept the Business Transaction.

2\. Execute the Runtime.

3\. Verify the Execution Trust Record.

4\. Generate a cryptographic Receipt.

5\. Return the completed Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Pipeline Artifacts



After execution, the Trust Record contains:



\- Business Transaction

\- Execution

\- Verification

\- Receipt

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Signature



These artifacts together provide cryptographic evidence of the complete execution.

Pipeline Artifacts

\------------------------------



✓ Business Transaction : txn-000001

✓ Verification        : 1

✓ Receipt             : 1

✓ Trust Record Hash   : ...



Execution Pipeline

\------------------------------



✓ Transaction Accepted

✓ Policy Evaluated

✓ Execution Authorized

✓ Execution Completed

✓ Verification Completed

✓ Receipt Generated

✓ Execution Trust Record Created



Tutorial completed successfully.

```

\## Why This Matters



Enterprise systems require more than successful execution.



They require evidence that:



\- the request was accepted,

\- policy evaluation succeeded,

\- execution completed,

\- verification succeeded,

\- a receipt was generated,

\- the complete lifecycle can be audited.



The Execution Trust Application automates this orchestration.

\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/32-execution-pipeline/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\*\*Tutorial 33 — Execution Boundary\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates how Parmana becomes the trusted boundary between AI systems and enterprise systems, ensuring only verified and authorized execution requests cross into business applications.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- The Execution Trust Application orchestrates the complete execution lifecycle.

\- Multiple runtime components work together as a single pipeline.

\- A completed Execution Trust Record contains immutable evidence of execution.

\- The pipeline prepares verified requests before they cross the enterprise execution boundary.
