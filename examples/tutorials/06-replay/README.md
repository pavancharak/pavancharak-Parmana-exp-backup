# \# Tutorial 06 — Replay

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# This tutorial demonstrates deterministic replay of an Execution Trust Record.

# 

# Replay re-executes the recorded policy decision using the original policy and execution signals to verify that the same decision is produced.

# 

# This capability provides independent verification and auditability.
