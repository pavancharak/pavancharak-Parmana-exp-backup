\# Tutorial 17 — Multi Policy Routing



This tutorial demonstrates how Parmana automatically routes a Business Transaction to the correct policy.



Unlike previous tutorials that focused on a single policy, this example shows that the runtime is completely independent of business policies. The runtime simply loads the policy referenced by the Business Transaction.



\## What You Will Learn



\* How Policy Routing works.

\* How the Runtime locates policies.

\* Why Runtime code never changes when new policies are added.

\* How Policy References drive deterministic execution.



\## Scenario



An enterprise may have hundreds of policies.



For example:



\* Vendor Payments

\* Purchase Orders

\* Customer Refunds

\* Production Deployments

\* Database Changes

\* GitHub Pull Requests



Instead of hardcoding these policies into the runtime, Parmana loads the correct policy at runtime using the Policy Reference contained within the Business Transaction.

Execution

```



\## Policy Reference



Every Business Transaction specifies the exact policy to execute.



```json

{

&#x20; "policy": {

&#x20;   "name": "vendor-payment",

&#x20;   "version": "2.0.0",

&#x20;   "schemaVersion": "1.0.0"

&#x20; }

}

```



The Runtime does not know anything about vendor payments, purchase orders, or any other business process.



It simply loads the requested policy and executes it.



\## Why This Matters



As organizations grow, they continuously introduce new governance policies.



With Parmana:



\* New policies are added.

\* Existing policies are versioned.

\* Old policies remain reproducible.

\* The Runtime never changes.



This separation allows the Runtime to remain stable while business authorization logic evolves independently.



\## Run



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/17-multi-policy-routing/run.ts

```



\## Expected Output



The example demonstrates:



\* Policy loading

\* Policy routing

\* Deterministic policy evaluation

\* Execution Trust Record generation

\* Verification

\* Receipt generation



\## Key Takeaway



The Parmana Runtime is policy-agnostic.



Business Transactions identify the exact policy to execute, the Policy Router loads that policy, and the Runtime executes it without containing any business-specific logic. This architecture enables a single runtime to support hundreds of independently versioned enterprise policies.
