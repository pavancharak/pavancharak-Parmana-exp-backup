\# Tutorial 16 — Runtime Pipeline



This tutorial demonstrates how to build a custom \*\*Runtime Pipeline\*\* by composing multiple Runtime Components.



Rather than extending the runtime with a single component, Parmana allows developers to assemble deterministic processing pipelines by registering multiple components in a specific order.



\## What You Will Learn



\* Build a Runtime Pipeline.

\* Register multiple Runtime Components.

\* Understand Runtime Component ordering.

\* Observe Runtime Context flowing through the pipeline.

\* Build custom runtime behavior without modifying Parmana.



\## Scenario



An enterprise wants every execution to perform three additional runtime tasks:



1\. Log execution details.

2\. Record runtime metrics.

3\. Send execution notifications.



Instead of changing Parmana's runtime, the organization builds a custom Runtime Pipeline.

Each Runtime Component receives the same immutable Runtime Context.



A component may:



\* Observe the Runtime Context.

\* Record metrics.

\* Produce logs.

\* Send notifications.

\* Enrich metadata.

\* Perform additional validation.



The Runtime Context is then passed to the next component.



\## Registering Components



The Runtime Pipeline is built using the Runtime Builder.



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(policyRepository)

&#x20;   .addStage(new LoggingComponent())

&#x20;   .addStage(new MetricsComponent())

&#x20;   .addStage(new NotificationComponent())

&#x20;   .build(...);

```



Components execute in the same order they are registered.



\## Why Pipelines?



Pipelines make runtime behavior composable.



Organizations can introduce new functionality without modifying Parmana's runtime implementation.



Common pipeline stages include:



\* Logging

\* Metrics

\* Distributed Tracing

\* Notifications

\* Audit Enrichment

\* Compliance Validation

\* Security Monitoring

\* Rate Limiting



\## Run



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/16-runtime-pipeline/run.ts

```



\## Expected Output



The example demonstrates:



\* Logging Component execution

\* Metrics Component execution

\* Notification Component execution

\* Execution Trust Record generation

\* Verification

\* Receipt generation



\## Key Takeaway



Parmana's runtime is a deterministic processing pipeline.



Organizations extend runtime behavior by composing Runtime Components rather than modifying the runtime engine itself. This approach keeps the core runtime stable while allowing enterprise-specific behavior to be added through reusable pipeline stages.
