\# Tutorial 14 — Custom Policy



This tutorial demonstrates how to create and execute a \*\*custom Parmana policy\*\* without modifying the Parmana runtime.



Instead of changing the runtime or policy engine, we introduce a new business policy named \*\*high-value-payment\*\* that extends the existing vendor payment authorization rules.



\## What You Will Learn



\* Create a new policy from an existing policy.

\* Add new runtime signals.

\* Introduce new business authorization rules.

\* Execute a Business Transaction using a custom policy.

\* Keep the runtime completely unchanged.



This demonstrates one of Parmana's core design principles:



> Enterprise business rules belong in policies, not in application code.



\## Scenario



A company introduces a new governance requirement:



> Any vendor payment greater than \*\*USD 10,000\*\* must be approved by a \*\*Finance Director\*\* before execution.



Rather than changing Parmana's runtime, a new policy is authored.



The runtime automatically loads the requested policy and evaluates it deterministically.

```



\## New Business Rule



The custom policy introduces a new runtime signal:



```text

financeDirectorApproved

```



The policy authorizes execution only when:



\* Vendor is verified.

\* Invoice is verified.

\* Payment is approved.

\* Funds are available.

\* Risk score is acceptable.

\* Payment amount is greater than USD 10,000.

\* Finance Director approval is present.



If the Finance Director approval is missing, the policy rejects the transaction before execution.



\## Run



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/14-custom-policy/run.ts

```



\## Expected Output



The example produces:



\* Approved Decision

\* Execution Authorization

\* Execution Trust Record

\* Verification Result

\* Cryptographically signed Receipt



\## Key Takeaway



Parmana separates \*\*business policy\*\* from \*\*runtime infrastructure\*\*.



New governance requirements are implemented by authoring new policies rather than changing runtime code, allowing organizations to evolve authorization rules while preserving deterministic execution, reproducibility, and cryptographic verification.
