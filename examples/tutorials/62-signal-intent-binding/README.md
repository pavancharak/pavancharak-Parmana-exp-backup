\# Tutorial 62 — Signal/Intent Binding



\## Overview



A policy evaluates `transaction.signals`. Execution runs `transaction.intent`. Nothing forces those two to describe the same real-world action — unless a policy declares `boundSignals`.



This tutorial demonstrates Parmana's signal/intent binding guarantee: a caller can declare any signals it likes, but for every signal a policy's `boundSignals` names, the declared value must exactly equal the value found at the matching `intent` field. A mismatch — including a signal the caller never declared at all — is rejected before policy evaluation ever runs, and no authorization is ever generated for it.



This is not a hypothetical concern. It closes a real, previously live gap: a caller could declare a fully verified, policy-approved payment while `intent` executed something else entirely, and still receive a signed, APPROVED Execution Trust Record for it. `SignalIntentBinder` (`packages/policy/src/SignalIntentBinder.ts`) is what stops that.



\---



\## The Policy Declaration



`policies/vendor-payment/2.0.0/policy.json` declares:



```json

"boundSignals": {

&#x20; "paymentAmount": "parameters.amount",

&#x20; "vendorId": "target"

}

```



This means: whatever `signals.vendorId` a caller declares must exactly equal `intent.target`. Both transactions in this tutorial share the same `intent.target`, `"sap.payment.release"` — only their `signals.vendorId` differs.



\---



\## Scenario 1: A Missing Signal



`transaction-mismatched-signal.json` declares every other signal `vendor-payment@2.0.0`'s approve rule needs — but never declares `vendorId` at all.



```ts

try {

&#x20; await runtime.execute(mismatchedSignalTransaction);

} catch (error) {

&#x20; console.log(`✗ ${(error as Error).message}`);

}

```



`SignalIntentBinder` runs before `PolicyEngine.evaluate`, over the exact signals about to be evaluated and the exact intent that would be signed and executed if approved. `signals.vendorId` (`undefined`) does not equal `intent.target` (`"sap.payment.release"`), so this is rejected as an ordinary policy decision — no rule is ever evaluated, and `ExecutionGate.enforce` throws before any authorization is generated.



\---



\## Scenario 2: The Same Transaction, Correctly Bound



`transaction-correctly-bound.json` is otherwise identical — same policy, same `intent.target`, same approve-shaped facts — except `signals.vendorId` is declared as `"sap.payment.release"`, matching `intent.target` exactly.



```ts

const { context } = await runtime.execute(correctlyBoundTransaction);



console.log(`✓ ${context.decision.outcome}`);

```



With the binding satisfied, `SignalIntentBinder` finds no violation, `PolicyEngine.evaluate` runs normally, and this transaction is approved and executed exactly like any other.

\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 62 - Signal/Intent Binding

==================================================



A policy evaluates transaction.signals. Execution runs transaction.intent.

boundSignals declares which signal must equal which intent field, so

the facts a policy approved are guaranteed to describe the same

real-world action the system actually executes — not just a payload

that happens to look correct in isolation.



vendor-payment@2.0.0 declares: boundSignals.vendorId = "target".

Every transaction below shares the same intent.target, "sap.payment.release".



--------------------------------------------------

Scenario 1: signals.vendorId is not declared

--------------------------------------------------



✗ Execution rejected: Rejected: declared signal(s) do not match the executed intent (vendorId=undefined != intent.target="sap.payment.release").



This is Parmana working as intended: the caller never declared a

vendorId signal at all, so nothing proves the approved facts describe

this specific intent.target. No authorization is generated for it.



--------------------------------------------------

Scenario 2: signals.vendorId matches intent.target

--------------------------------------------------



✓ APPROVED

Reason : Vendor payment authorized. Vendor verification, invoice verification, payment approval, funding, and risk assessment requirements were satisfied.



Same policy, same intent.target, same approve-shaped facts — the only

difference is that signals.vendorId now equals intent.target. That is

enough for SignalIntentBinder to confirm the two describe the same

action, so PolicyEngine.evaluate runs and this executes normally.



==================================================

Summary

==================================================



Scenario 1 : REJECTED — vendorId signal missing, cannot be bound to intent.target

Scenario 2 : APPROVED — vendorId signal declared and matches intent.target

\## Design Principles



`boundSignals` only closes the *decoupling* between what a policy evaluates and what actually executes, for the specific fields a policy author declares bound. It does not independently verify that an unbound signal is true — a caller-declared `vendorVerified: true` is still taken on faith unless a policy author separately fetch-verifies it (see `RazorpaySettlementProcessor` and Tutorial 61 for what that looks like for one real connector).



A rejection here is not an error to work around. It is the system correctly refusing to sign an authorization for an action it cannot confirm the approved facts actually describe.

\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/62-signal-intent-binding/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned how to:



\- Read a policy's `boundSignals` declaration and know exactly which signals it constrains

\- Recognize a signal/intent binding rejection and its exact wording

\- Confirm that a correctly-bound transaction executes identically to any other

\- Understand why this check runs before policy evaluation, not after



This is the same guarantee that closed a real, previously live authorization bypass: without it, a caller could declare small, fully-verified signals while `intent` executed an arbitrary action, and still walk away with a signed, APPROVED Execution Trust Record.
