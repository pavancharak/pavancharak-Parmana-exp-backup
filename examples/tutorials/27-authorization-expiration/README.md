\# Tutorial 27 — Authorization Expiration



\## Overview



In the previous tutorial, we verified that a newly generated Execution Authorization was valid.



This tutorial demonstrates that a valid digital signature alone is \*\*not sufficient\*\*.



Every Execution Authorization has an expiration time. Once that time has passed, the authorization must be rejected even if its signature remains cryptographically valid.

\## Why Expiration Exists



Execution Authorizations are intentionally short-lived.



Short-lived authorizations reduce the impact of:



\- intercepted authorization envelopes

\- delayed execution

\- replay attacks

\- compromised execution channels



An authorization should only be usable during the period for which Parmana explicitly approved it.



\---



\## Executing the Transaction



```ts

const { context } =

&#x20; await runtime.execute(transaction);

```



The Runtime returns a signed authorization.



```ts

const authorization =

&#x20; context.authorization;

```



\---



\## Simulating Time Passing



The verifier accepts an optional verification time.



Instead of verifying using the current time, this tutorial verifies after the authorization has expired.



```ts

const expiresAt =

&#x20; new Date(

&#x20;   authorization.payload.expiresAt,

&#x20; );



const future =

&#x20; new Date(

&#x20;   expiresAt.getTime() + 60\_000,

&#x20; );

```



\---



\## Verifying the Authorization



```ts

const result =

&#x20; await verifier.verify(

&#x20;   authorization,

&#x20;   publicKey,

&#x20;   future,

&#x20; );

```



The signature is still valid.



However, the authorization has expired.



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 27 - Authorization Expiration

==================================================



Executing transaction...



✓ Execution Authorization generated.



Verifying expired authorization...



Valid               : false

Version Supported   : true

Signature Verified  : true

Not Expired         : false



✓ Authorization correctly rejected.



Tutorial completed successfully.

```



\---



\## Verification Results



| Check | Result |

|-------|--------|

| Version Supported | ✓ |

| Signature Verified | ✓ |

| Not Expired | ✗ |

| Overall Valid | ✗ |



Notice that the signature remains valid.



The authorization is rejected solely because it has expired.



\---



\## Security Benefits



Expiration prevents previously valid authorizations from being reused indefinitely.



Even if an attacker obtains a signed authorization, it becomes unusable after its expiration time.



This limits the lifetime of every execution request.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/27-authorization-expiration/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

The next tutorial demonstrates how Parmana prevents the same authorization from being accepted more than once.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Execution Authorizations are time-limited.

\- Signature verification alone is not sufficient.

\- Expired authorizations are rejected.

\- Authorization expiration is an important defense against replay attacks.



Expiration is one of several independent checks performed before enterprise execution is allowed.
