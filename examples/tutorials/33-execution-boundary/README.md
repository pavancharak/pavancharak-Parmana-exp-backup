\# Tutorial 33 — Execution Boundary



\## Overview



Parmana governs \*\*authorization\*\*, not enterprise execution.



Its responsibility ends after producing a valid \*\*Execution Authorization\*\*.



The enterprise system begins execution only after receiving that authorization.



This separation is called the \*\*Execution Boundary\*\*.

\## Why the Boundary Exists



Parmana intentionally does \*\*not\*\*:



\- connect directly to SAP

\- release payments

\- create vendors

\- update ERP records

\- own enterprise credentials



Instead Parmana produces an immutable \*\*Execution Authorization\*\* proving that execution has been approved.



The enterprise execution system decides whether to execute the request.



\---



\## Runtime Responsibilities



The Runtime:



\- evaluates policy

\- creates a Decision

\- generates an Execution Authorization

\- records execution evidence

\- produces an Execution Trust Record



After that, Parmana's work is complete.



\---



\## Enterprise Responsibilities



The enterprise system:



\- receives the Execution Authorization

\- validates it

\- executes the approved action

\- returns execution evidence



Execution itself belongs to the enterprise system, not Parmana.

✓ Policy evaluated.

✓ Execution authorized.

✓ Execution request created.



============== Execution Boundary ==============



Everything above is governed by Parmana.



Everything below belongs to the enterprise execution system.



Enterprise Execution

executes only after receiving

a valid Execution Authorization.

Policy           : vendor-payment@2.0.0

Execution Boundary Summary

\--------------------------------------------------



• Parmana authorizes execution.

• Parmana never executes enterprise actions.

• Enterprise systems execute only authorized requests.

\## Key Principle



Parmana is \*\*not\*\* an ERP.



Parmana is \*\*not\*\* an API gateway.



Parmana is \*\*not\*\* an AI agent.



Parmana is the \*\*Execution Authorization Layer\*\* that sits between AI and enterprise systems.

\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Parmana governs execution authorization.

\- Parmana does not perform enterprise actions.

\- Enterprise systems execute only after receiving authorization.

\- The Execution Boundary separates governance from execution.
