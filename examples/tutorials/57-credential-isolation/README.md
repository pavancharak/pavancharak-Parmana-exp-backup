\# Tutorial 57 — Credential Isolation

\## Objective

In this tutorial, you'll observe Parmana's core credential-isolation invariant directly: the caller of an execution — an AI agent, the Runtime, or the Gateway — never possesses an enterprise credential's secret value. Only a single-use, time-bounded session lease is ever visible outside the Secure Connector boundary.

\## What You'll Learn

\* Store a raw enterprise credential in a CredentialVault

\* Wrap it in a SessionCredentialVault for single-use, time-bounded leasing

\* Issue a session credential and confirm it carries no secret material

\* Consume a session credential to resolve the secret exactly once

\* Confirm reuse of a consumed session credential is rejected

\* Confirm consumption after explicit revocation is rejected

\## Architecture

```text

CredentialVault (raw secret)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

SessionCredentialVault.issue()

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

SessionCredential (id + timestamps only)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

SessionCredentialVault.consume() — the secret appears here, once

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

revoke() — destroyed

==================================================



Underlying Credential Vault

\--------------------------------------------------

✓ Enterprise credential stored for connector "sap".



Issuing A Session Credential

\--------------------------------------------------

Session Credential ID : 13937eda-239d-405d-bd0d-169628444417

Connector              : sap

Authorization           : authorization-001

Issued At               : 2026-07-11T08:50:39.945Z

Expires At              : 2026-07-11T08:51:09.945Z



✓ No credential secret appears above — only identifiers and timestamps.



Consuming The Session Credential (inside the Secure Connector)

\--------------------------------------------------

✓ Secret resolved for exactly this execution.

&#x20; Resolved value keys: apiKey



Reuse Rejection

\--------------------------------------------------

✓ Reuse rejected:

&#x20; Session credential has already been used: 13937eda-239d-405d-bd0d-169628444417.



Explicit Revocation

\--------------------------------------------------

✓ Consumption after revocation rejected:

&#x20; Session credential has been revoked: ac988a7d-eecf-4c42-ad5c-cb620ffe4b93.

\## Why This Matters

A credential that lives for the whole session, or that an AI agent can read directly, is a credential that can leak, be logged, or be replayed outside its intended execution. Parmana's SessionCredentialVault only ever hands out an opaque identifier and a time window — the underlying value is resolved fresh, inside the Secure Connector, exactly once, and is unreachable before or after that single moment.
