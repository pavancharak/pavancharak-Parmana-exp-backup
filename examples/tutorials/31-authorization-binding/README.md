\# Tutorial 31 — Authorization Binding



\## Overview



In previous tutorials we verified that an Execution Authorization was:



\- correctly signed

\- not expired

\- not replayed



This tutorial demonstrates another critical security property:



> \*\*An Execution Authorization is cryptographically bound to the exact executable request that Parmana approved.\*\*



A valid authorization cannot be reused for another payment, invoice, vendor, or business transaction.

\## Why Authorization Binding Exists



Suppose Parmana approved:



```text

Vendor A



Invoice INV-1001



Amount $25,000

```



An attacker must never be able to reuse that authorization for:



```text

Vendor A



Invoice INV-1001



Amount $50,000

```



Although the authorization itself is genuine, it is bound to the original executable content.



Changing any execution parameter changes the executable content hash.



\---



\## Executable Content



The Runtime computes a deterministic hash of the executable request.



```ts

const hash =

&#x20; await hasher.hash(

&#x20;   executableContent,

&#x20; );

```



That hash is embedded inside the signed Execution Authorization.



\---



\## Verification



Before execution, the enterprise system recomputes the executable content hash.



```ts

const computedHash =

&#x20; await hasher.hash(

&#x20;   modifiedContent,

&#x20; );

```



It compares that value against:



```ts

authorization.payload.businessTransactionHash

```



If the hashes differ, execution is rejected.



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 31 - Authorization Binding

==================================================



Generating authorization...



✓ Authorization generated.



✓ Authorization verified.



Execution Binding Check

\------------------------------



Authorization Hash : ...



Execution Hash     : ...



✓ Execution rejected.



Reason: Authorization is bound to a different executable request.

\## Security Guarantees



Authorization Binding prevents:



\- payment amount substitution

\- invoice substitution

\- vendor substitution

\- target system substitution

\- parameter manipulation



The authorization can only be used for the executable content originally approved by Parmana.



\---



\## Cryptographic Layers



Execution security now consists of multiple independent checks.

Expiration Check

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

```



Every layer must succeed before execution proceeds.

\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/31-authorization-binding/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

\*\*Tutorial 32 — Multi-Step Execution\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates how a single Business Transaction can authorize multiple execution steps while preserving verification and auditability.

\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Execution Authorizations are bound to executable content.

\- Enterprise systems recompute the executable content hash.

\- Any modification changes the hash.

\- Hash mismatch causes execution to be rejected.

\- Authorization Binding ensures Parmana-approved work cannot be redirected to a different request.
