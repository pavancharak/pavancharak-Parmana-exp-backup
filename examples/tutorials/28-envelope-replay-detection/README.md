\# Tutorial 28 — Envelope Replay Detection



\## Overview



In the previous tutorials we learned how Parmana generates and verifies Execution Authorizations.



This tutorial demonstrates how Parmana prevents the \*\*same authorization\*\* from being accepted more than once.



Even when:



\- the signature is valid,

\- the authorization has not expired,

\- the payload has not been modified,



the second attempt is rejected because the authorization nonce has already been consumed.

&#x20;       ▼

✗ Replay Detected

```



\---



\## Why Replay Protection Exists



Without replay protection an attacker could capture a valid authorization and execute it repeatedly until it expired.



Replay detection guarantees that every authorization can only be accepted once.



\---



\## Building the Runtime



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(

&#x20;     new FilePolicyRepository("policies"),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .build(

&#x20;     new MemoryExecutionTrustRecordRepository(),

&#x20;   );

```



\---



\## Generating the Authorization



```ts

const { context } =

&#x20; await runtime.execute(transaction);



const authorization =

&#x20; context.authorization!;

```



\---



\## Creating the Envelope Verifier



```ts

const verifier =

&#x20; new EnvelopeVerifier({

&#x20;   publicKey,

&#x20;   nonceStore:

&#x20;     new MemoryNonceStore(),

&#x20; });

```



The verifier combines:



\- signature verification

\- expiration validation

\- TTL policy

\- replay detection



\---



\## First Verification



```ts

const first =

&#x20; await verifier.verify(

&#x20;   authorization,

&#x20; );

```



Result:



```text

✓ Accepted

```



The nonce is recorded.



\---



\## Second Verification



```ts

const second =

&#x20; await verifier.verify(

&#x20;   authorization,

&#x20; );

```



Result:



```text

✗ Replay Detected

```



The authorization itself has not changed.



Only the nonce state has changed.



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 28 - Envelope Replay Detection

==================================================



Generating authorization...



✓ Authorization generated.



First verification...



Valid           : true

Nonce Unseen    : true



✓ Authorization accepted.



Second verification...



Valid           : false

Nonce Unseen    : false



✓ Replay detected.

\## Verification Lifecycle



```text

Authorization

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verify Signature

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verify Expiration

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verify TTL

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Consume Nonce

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execute

```



The nonce is consumed only after every other verification succeeds.



This prevents invalid or forged authorizations from exhausting nonce values.



\---



\## Development vs Production



This tutorial uses:



```text

MemoryNonceStore

```



The in-memory implementation is intended only for examples and local development.



Production deployments should use a persistent implementation backed by Redis, a database, or another durable store so replay protection survives process restarts.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/28-envelope-replay-detection/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Next Tutorial



\*\*Tutorial 29 — Authorization Tampering\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates how modifying any field of a signed Execution Authorization causes signature verification to fail.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Replay attacks are detected independently of signature verification.

\- Every authorization nonce can be accepted only once.

\- EnvelopeVerifier combines cryptographic verification with replay protection.

\- NonceStore provides the foundation for secure execution authorization.
