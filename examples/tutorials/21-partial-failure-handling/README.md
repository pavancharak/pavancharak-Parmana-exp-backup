\# Tutorial 21 — Partial Failure Handling



\## Overview



This tutorial demonstrates how Parmana continues processing independent Business Transactions even when some of them fail.



Each transaction is executed independently through the Runtime. A failure in one transaction does not stop the remaining transactions from being processed.



This pattern is commonly used for:



\- Payment processing

\- Invoice processing

\- Purchase order approval

\- Financial reconciliation

\- Scheduled enterprise jobs

\- Large-scale transaction processing

\## Partial Failure Handling



```

&#x20;               Runtime

&#x20;                  │

&#x20;                  ▼



Transaction 1 ─────────► APPROVED



Transaction 2 ─────────► FAILED



Transaction 3 ─────────► APPROVED



Transaction 4 ─────────► REJECTED



&#x20;                  │

&#x20;                  ▼



&#x20;            Failure Summary

```



Every Business Transaction remains isolated from the others.



\---



\## Runtime Construction



A single Runtime instance is reused throughout the batch.



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(

&#x20;     new FilePolicyRepository("policies"),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .build(repository);

```



\---



\## Executing Transactions



Each transaction is executed inside its own `try/catch` block.



```ts

for (const transaction of transactions) {

&#x20; try {

&#x20;   await runtime.execute(transaction);

&#x20; } catch (error) {

&#x20;   // Record the failure and continue.

&#x20; }

}

```



This ensures the remaining transactions continue executing regardless of previous failures.



\---



\## Recording Failures



Failures are collected into a report.



```ts

failures.push({

&#x20; businessTransactionId,

&#x20; reason,

});

```



At the end of processing, a summary is generated showing both successful and failed transactions.

\## Why Continue Processing?



Enterprise workloads often contain hundreds or thousands of independent Business Transactions.



Stopping the entire batch because one transaction fails would:



\- Reduce throughput

\- Delay unrelated work

\- Increase operational overhead



Instead, each transaction is evaluated independently while failures are reported separately.



\---



\## Design Principles



Every transaction has its own:



\- Policy Evaluation

\- Decision

\- Execution

\- Authorization

\- Execution Trust Record



There is no shared execution state between transactions.



This isolation allows Parmana to provide deterministic governance while supporting resilient batch processing.

\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/21-partial-failure-handling/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned how to:



\- Process multiple independent Business Transactions

\- Continue execution after individual failures

\- Capture failure information without stopping the batch

\- Produce a clear execution summary



Partial Failure Handling is a common enterprise execution pattern that improves reliability while maintaining deterministic governance for every transaction.
