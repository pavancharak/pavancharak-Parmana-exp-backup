\# Tutorial 40 — Signature Forgery



\## Overview



A signature forgery attack occurs when an attacker attempts to fabricate an Execution Authorization without possessing Parmana's private signing key.



Although the authorization payload may appear legitimate, the digital signature cannot be reproduced without the corresponding private key.



The Execution Gateway verifies every authorization using Parmana's public key before allowing execution.

\## Attack Scenario

Attacker



&#x20;       │



Creates fake

Execution Authorization



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Fake Digital Signature

Execution Gateway



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Signature Verification



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



✗ Invalid Signature



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Rejected

```



\---



\## Genuine Authorization



```text

Payload



✓ Valid



Signature



✓ Produced by Parmana

```



\---



\## Forged Authorization



```text

Payload



✓ Looks Correct



Signature



✗ Fabricated

```



The payload may be identical.



Only the signature has changed.

\## Expected Output

Version Supported : true

Signature Valid   : false

Not Expired       : true



✓ Signature forgery detected.



Execution rejected.

\## Why Digital Signatures Matter



An attacker can copy an authorization.



An attacker can read an authorization.



An attacker can modify an authorization.



What an attacker \*\*cannot\*\* do is generate a valid signature without Parmana's private signing key.



This is the foundation of trust for every Execution Authorization.



\---



\## Gateway Validation



The gateway performs cryptographic verification before considering any business logic.



```text

Execution Authorization

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Version Check

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Signature Verification

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Expiration Check

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Decision

```



If signature verification fails, execution stops immediately.

\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/40-signature-forgery/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\*\*Tutorial 41 — Expired Authorization\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates that even a correctly signed authorization is rejected after its validity period has expired.

\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Execution Authorizations are digitally signed.

\- Only Parmana's private key can produce a valid signature.

\- The Execution Gateway verifies signatures before execution.

\- Forged authorizations are rejected immediately.
