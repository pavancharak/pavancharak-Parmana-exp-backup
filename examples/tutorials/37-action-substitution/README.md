\# Tutorial 37 — Action Substitution



\## Overview



Action substitution is an attack where a valid Execution Authorization is reused to execute a different business operation than the one originally approved.



For example, an authorization issued for \*\*releasing a payment\*\* must never be accepted to \*\*create a vendor\*\*.



Parmana prevents this by binding the authorization to the complete executable content, including the business action.

\## Attack Scenario



```text

Authorized Request



Action



release-payment



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Authorization



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Attacker modifies action



release-payment

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

create-vendor



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Gateway recomputes executable hash



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



✗ Hash Mismatch



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Rejected

```



\---



\## Original Request



```text

Action



release-payment



Target



vendor



Parameters



invoiceId

vendorId

paymentAmount

currency

```



\---



\## Modified Request



```text

Action



create-vendor



Target



vendor



Parameters



invoiceId

vendorId

paymentAmount

currency

```



Only the action changed.



That single modification changes the executable content hash.

\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 37 - Action Substitution

==================================================



Authorized Action



release-payment



Substituted Action



create-vendor



Original Hash



4b7761f6...



Substituted Hash



b93b8c27...



✓ Action substitution detected.



Execution rejected.



Tutorial completed successfully.

```

\## Why This Matters



Without authorization binding an attacker could reuse a valid authorization for an entirely different business operation.



Examples include:



\- release-payment → create-vendor

\- create-vendor → release-payment

\- approve-invoice → release-payment

\- release-payment → delete-vendor



Execution Authorization prevents this because the action is part of the signed executable content.



\---



\## Protected Fields



The executable content includes:



\- action

\- target

\- parameters

\- business transaction identifier



Changing any of these values changes the executable content hash.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/37-action-substitution/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Next Tutorial



\*\*Tutorial 38 — Target Substitution\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates that even if the action remains unchanged, changing the execution target (for example SAP → Oracle) invalidates the authorization.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Execution Authorization is bound to the business action.

\- Changing the action changes the executable content hash.

\- The gateway detects the mismatch.

\- Action substitution is rejected before enterprise execution.
