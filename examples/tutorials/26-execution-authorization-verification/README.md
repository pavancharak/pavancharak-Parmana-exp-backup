\# Tutorial 26 — Execution Authorization Verification



\## Overview



In Tutorial 25, the Runtime generated a signed Execution Authorization after successfully evaluating a Business Transaction.



This tutorial demonstrates how an enterprise system independently verifies that authorization before allowing execution.



Verification proves that:



\- The authorization was issued by Parmana.

\- The authorization has not been modified.

\- The authorization format is supported.

\- The authorization has not expired.



Only verified authorizations should be trusted to cross the execution boundary.

\## Execution Flow



```

&#x20;       ▼

Parmana Runtime

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Signed Execution Authorization

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

AuthorizationVerifier

&#x20;       ▼

✓ VALID

\## Building the Runtime



The Runtime produces a signed Execution Authorization.



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(

&#x20;     new FilePolicyRepository("policies"),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .build(

&#x20;     new MemoryExecutionTrustRecordRepository(),

&#x20;   );

```



\---



\## Executing the Transaction



```ts

const { context } =

&#x20; await runtime.execute(transaction);

```



The Runtime Context contains the generated authorization.



```ts

const authorization =

&#x20; context.authorization;

```



\---



\## Loading the Public Key



The Runtime signs using Parmana's private key.



Verification uses the corresponding public key.



```ts

const keyProvider =

&#x20; new FileKeyProvider();



const publicKey =

&#x20; await keyProvider.getPublicKey(

&#x20;   authorization.keyId,

&#x20; );

```



\---



\## Verifying the Authorization



```ts

const verifier =

&#x20; new AuthorizationVerifier(

&#x20;   CryptoBootstrap.create(),

&#x20; );



const result =

&#x20; await verifier.verify(

&#x20;   authorization,

&#x20;   publicKey,

&#x20; );

```



The verifier performs multiple independent checks.



\---



\## Verification Checks



The verification result contains:



| Check | Purpose |

|-------|---------|

| `versionSupported` | Payload version is recognized |

| `signatureVerified` | Digital signature is valid |

| `notExpired` | Authorization is still valid |

| `valid` | Overall verification result |



Every check is reported independently to simplify troubleshooting.



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 26 - Execution Authorization Verification

==================================================



Executing transaction...



✓ Execution Authorization generated.



Verifying authorization...



Valid               : true

Version Supported   : true

Signature Verified  : true

Not Expired         : true



✓ Execution Authorization verified.



Tutorial completed successfully.

```



\---



\## Why Verification Matters



Execution Authorization should never be trusted simply because it was received.



The receiving system must independently verify:



\- Signature authenticity

\- Payload integrity

\- Authorization validity

\- Supported payload version



This prevents forged or modified authorizations from reaching enterprise systems.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/26-execution-authorization-verification/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Next Tutorial



\*\*Tutorial 27 — Authorization Expiration\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates how expired Execution Authorizations are rejected even when their signatures remain valid.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned how to:



\- Retrieve the Runtime-generated Execution Authorization.

\- Load Parmana's public key.

\- Verify the authorization independently.

\- Interpret the verification checks.

\- Allow execution only after successful verification.



Execution Authorization verification is the first step in protecting the execution boundary between AI systems and enterprise applications.
