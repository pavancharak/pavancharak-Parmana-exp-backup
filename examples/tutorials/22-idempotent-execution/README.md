\# Tutorial 22 — Idempotent Execution



\## Overview



This tutorial demonstrates retrying the same Business Transaction multiple times.



In distributed systems, retries are common because of:



\- Network failures

\- Client timeouts

\- Process restarts

\- Queue redelivery

\- Infrastructure failures



An execution platform must be able to handle retries safely.



This tutorial shows what happens when the same Business Transaction is submitted repeatedly.

\## Retry Flow



```

Business Transaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Runtime

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution



Retry

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Same Business Transaction



Retry

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Same Business Transaction

```



The same Business Transaction is executed three times using the same `businessTransactionId`.



\---



\## Building the Runtime



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(

&#x20;     new FilePolicyRepository("policies"),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .build(repository);

```



The Runtime is created once and reused for every execution attempt.



\---



\## Executing Retries



```ts

await runtime.execute(transaction);



await runtime.execute(transaction);



await runtime.execute(transaction);

```



Each retry uses exactly the same Business Transaction.

\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 22 - Idempotent Execution

==================================================



First execution...

✓ APPROVED



Retry #1...

✓ Retry completed.



Retry #2...

✓ Retry completed.



==================================================

Summary

==================================================



Original Executions : 1

Retries             : 2



Tutorial completed successfully.

```



The exact runtime behaviour depends on the configured repository and Runtime implementation.



\---



\## Why Idempotency Matters



Enterprise systems frequently retry requests automatically.



Typical examples include:



\- Payment processing

\- Invoice approval

\- Purchase order creation

\- Vendor onboarding

\- ERP integrations



Without idempotency, retries could unintentionally execute the same business action multiple times.



\---



\## Current Tutorial Scope



This tutorial demonstrates retry behaviour using the existing Parmana Runtime.



It intentionally does \*\*not\*\* introduce any new Runtime APIs or idempotency mechanisms.



Future versions of Parmana may provide first-class idempotency support while preserving the same Runtime programming model.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/22-idempotent-execution/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned how to:



\- Reuse a Runtime instance

\- Retry the same Business Transaction

\- Observe Runtime behaviour across repeated executions

\- Understand why idempotency is important in enterprise execution systems



Idempotent execution is a foundational concept for building reliable, fault-tolerant enterprise applications.
