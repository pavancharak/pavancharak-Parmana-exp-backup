\# Tutorial 12 — Envelope Verification



\## Objective



This tutorial demonstrates how a downstream execution system verifies a Parmana Execution Authorization before executing business logic.



Unlike policy evaluation, envelope verification does \*\*not\*\* determine whether an action should be allowed. It verifies that Parmana has already authorized the action.



\---



\## What this tutorial demonstrates



The runtime:



\- Evaluates policy

\- Produces a Decision

\- Generates a signed Execution Authorization



The downstream system:



\- Verifies the signature

\- Confirms the authorization has not expired

\- Validates the authorization TTL

\- Performs replay protection using the nonce



Only after all checks succeed should execution proceed.



\---



\## Run



```bash

npx tsx examples/tutorials/12-envelope-verification/run.ts

```



\---



\## Expected output



The verification result contains:



```json

{

&#x20; "valid": true,

&#x20; "checks": {

&#x20;   "signatureVerified": true,

&#x20;   "notExpired": true,

&#x20;   "ttlWithinPolicy": true,

&#x20;   "nonceUnseen": true

&#x20; }

}

```

This tutorial demonstrates the trust boundary between Parmana and downstream execution systems. Execution systems do not re-evaluate enterprise policy—they verify that Parmana authorized the request and that the authorization remains valid.
