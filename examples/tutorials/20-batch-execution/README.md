\# Tutorial 20 — Batch Execution



\## Overview



This tutorial demonstrates how to execute multiple Business Transactions using a single Parmana Runtime instance.



Rather than creating a new Runtime for every transaction, the Runtime is initialized once and reused to process a batch of transactions sequentially.



This approach is suitable for:



\- Scheduled payment processing

\- Invoice processing

\- Purchase order approvals

\- Payroll execution

\- Financial reconciliation

\- Any workload involving multiple independent Business Transactions

\## Batch Execution



```

&#x20;                  ▼

┌─────────────────────────────────┐

│ Transaction 1                   │

│        │                        │

│        ▼                        │

│ Execution Trust Record          │

&#x20;            Batch Summary

```



Each transaction is evaluated independently.



A failure in one transaction does not prevent the remaining transactions from executing.



\---



\## Building the Runtime



The Runtime is created once and reused throughout the batch.



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(

&#x20;     new FilePolicyRepository("policies"),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .build(repository);

```



\---



\## Processing the Batch



```ts

for (const transaction of transactions) {

&#x20; await runtime.execute(transaction);

}

```



Each Business Transaction produces its own:



\- Decision

\- Execution

\- Execution Trust Record



\---



\## Error Handling



Each transaction is executed inside its own `try/catch` block.



```ts

try {

&#x20; await runtime.execute(transaction);

} catch (error) {

&#x20; // Continue processing

}

```



This allows the batch to complete even when one or more transactions fail.

Processing transaction 1...

Processing transaction 2...

✓ APPROVED



Processing transaction 3...

✗ REJECTED



==================================================

Batch Summary

==================================================



Total Transactions : 3

Successful         : 2

Failed             : 1



Tutorial completed successfully.

```



\---



\## Design Principles



Each Business Transaction remains completely independent.



Every transaction has its own:



\- Decision

\- Execution

\- Authorization

\- Execution Trust Record

\- Verification

\- Receipt



Batch execution is simply an orchestration pattern that reuses a Runtime instance efficiently. It does not merge or combine transaction state.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/20-batch-execution/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned how to:



\- Reuse a single Runtime instance

\- Execute multiple Business Transactions

\- Handle successes and failures independently

\- Produce a summary of batch execution results



This pattern is commonly used for scheduled jobs, financial processing, and enterprise workloads where many independent transactions must be governed consistently through the same Runtime.
