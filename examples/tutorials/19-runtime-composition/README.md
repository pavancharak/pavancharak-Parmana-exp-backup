\# Tutorial 19 — Runtime Composition



\## Overview



This tutorial demonstrates how to compose a Parmana Runtime from reusable building blocks.



Instead of creating a monolithic Runtime, Parmana encourages composing small, focused components that each have a single responsibility.



In this tutorial, the Runtime is composed from:



\- Policy Repository

\- Runtime Component

\- Logging Hook

\- Metrics Hook

\## Runtime Composition

&#x20;       ▼

Runtime Components

```



Each piece has a dedicated responsibility and can be reused across multiple Runtime configurations.



\---



\## Components Used



\### Policy Repository



Responsible for loading the correct policy version.



```ts

new FilePolicyRepository("policies")

```



\---



\### Runtime Component



Runtime Components participate in execution.



Typical responsibilities include:



\- Runtime enrichment

\- Validation

\- Metadata generation

\- Custom execution logic



```ts

.addStage(

&#x20;   new CustomRuntimeComponent(),

)

```



\---



\### Runtime Hooks



Hooks observe Runtime execution.



Typical responsibilities include:



\- Logging

\- Metrics

\- Tracing

\- Notifications

\- Auditing



Hooks must never modify Runtime state.



```ts

.addHook(

&#x20;   new LoggingHook(),

)

.addHook(

&#x20;   new MetricsHook(),

)

```



\---



\## Building the Runtime



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .withPolicyRepository(

&#x20;     new FilePolicyRepository("policies"),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .addStage(

&#x20;     new CustomRuntimeComponent(),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .addHook(

&#x20;     new LoggingHook(),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .addHook(

&#x20;     new MetricsHook(),

&#x20;   )

&#x20;   .build(repository);

```

\## Runtime Components vs Runtime Hooks



| Runtime Components | Runtime Hooks |

|--------------------|---------------|

| Participate in execution | Observe execution |

| May enrich Runtime Context | Must not modify Runtime Context |

| Change Runtime behaviour | Record Runtime behaviour |

| Execute within the Runtime Pipeline | Execute alongside the Runtime lifecycle |



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/19-runtime-composition/run.ts

```



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 19 - Runtime Composition

==================================================



\[Hook] Loading policy...

\[Metrics] Policy Load: 1.12 ms



\[Hook] Evaluating policy...

\[Metrics] Policy Evaluation: 0.38 ms



\[Component] Enriching execution metadata.



\[Hook] Runtime pipeline completed.



==================================================

Execution Complete

==================================================



Runtime successfully composed from:



✓ Policy Repository

✓ Runtime Component

✓ Logging Hook

✓ Metrics Hook



Tutorial completed successfully.

\## Design Principles



Parmana promotes composition over inheritance.



Each Runtime capability is implemented as an independent building block that can be combined as needed.



This approach provides:



\- Reusable Runtime configurations

\- Clear separation of responsibilities

\- Easier testing

\- Simpler maintenance

\- Enterprise extensibility



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned how to compose a Runtime from reusable components rather than embedding all behavior into a single implementation.



This composition model enables organizations to build Runtime configurations tailored to their governance, compliance, and operational requirements while keeping each extension focused and maintainable.
