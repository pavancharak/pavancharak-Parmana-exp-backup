# \# Tutorial 08 — Human Approval

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# This tutorial demonstrates how Parmana enforces Human Authority before executing a Business Transaction.

# 

# Before a transaction can be evaluated against policy, it must contain valid Authority, Authorization, and Intent information. These records establish who authorized the action, why it was authorized, and what action is permitted.

# 

# This tutorial focuses on the authorization chain rather than policy evaluation.
