\# Tutorial 58 — Session Credentials

\## Objective

In this tutorial, you'll exercise the full session-credential lifecycle: issue, consume within the lifetime window, expire, reuse rejection, and explicit revocation — using a real one-second lifetime and a real delay, so expiry is something you actually observe happen rather than simulate.

\## What You'll Learn

\* Issue a session credential with a short, real lifetime

\* Consume it successfully within the lifetime window

\* Observe a genuine, time-based expiry rejection

\* Confirm a consumed session credential cannot be reused

\* Confirm a revoked session credential cannot be consumed

\---

\## Architecture

```text

issue() ──► consume() within lifetime  → secret resolved once

issue() ──► wait past lifetimeMs ──► consume()  → rejected: expired

issue() ──► consume() ──► consume() again        → rejected: already used

issue() ──► revoke() ──► consume()                → rejected: revoked

```

==================================================



Happy Path

\--------------------------------------------------

Issued  : b3854e32-a2d7-4bcd-aacf-68dc060d2aec

Consumed: token

✓ Consumed within the lifetime window.



Expiry

\--------------------------------------------------

Issued at : 2026-07-11T08:51:14.253Z

Expires at: 2026-07-11T08:51:15.253Z

Waiting past the 1-second lifetime...

✓ Consumption after expiry rejected:

&#x20; Session credential has expired: cd1a0379-04b2-443e-b24f-f1d9615af3c4.



Reuse

\--------------------------------------------------

✓ First consumption succeeded.

✓ Second consumption rejected:

&#x20; Session credential has already been used: dcfebec7-522e-40d0-974f-cf7c6e746184.



Revocation

\--------------------------------------------------

✓ Session credential revoked before use.

✓ Consumption after revocation rejected:

&#x20; Session credential has been revoked: eee06567-6e30-42b7-9e54-d1d270040387.

\## Why This Matters

Every one of these four rejection modes closes a distinct attack window: expiry bounds how long a captured session lease is useful, single-use prevents a lease from being replayed, and revocation lets a caller destroy a lease outright — including on a failure path, before it is ever consumed. Together they mean a session credential is worthless outside the exact moment it was issued for.
