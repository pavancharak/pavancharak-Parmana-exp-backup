\# Tutorial 44 — Direct API Bypass



\## Overview



This tutorial demonstrates one of Parmana's most important security guarantees:



\*\*Enterprise systems should never accept sensitive requests directly from AI agents.\*\*



Instead, every protected operation must pass through the Parmana Execution Gateway.



If a request does not include a valid Execution Authorization, execution stops immediately.

\## Architecture



```text

AI Agent

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

Enterprise API



✗ Direct Call



Rejected



────────────────────────────

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

✓ Accepted

```

\## Attack Scenario



An attacker (or buggy AI agent) attempts to invoke a protected enterprise API directly.



```text

POST /payments



Authorization



None



↓



Execution Gateway



↓



✗ Missing Execution Authorization



↓



Rejected

```



\---



\## Legitimate Flow



```text

Business Transaction



↓



Policy Evaluation



↓



Execution Authorization



↓



Gateway Verification



↓



Enterprise Execution

```



Every execution request must carry a valid Execution Authorization.



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 44 - Direct API Bypass

==================================================



Legitimate Request

\--------------------------------------------------



✓ Execution Authorization present.



Direct API Call

\--------------------------------------------------



✗ No Execution Authorization supplied.



Gateway rejected the request.



Reason:



Sensitive APIs only accept requests

that carry a valid Execution Authorization.



Tutorial completed successfully.

\## Why This Matters



Without an execution boundary, an AI agent could invoke enterprise APIs directly.



Examples include:



\- ERP APIs

\- Banking APIs

\- Payment APIs

\- HR Systems

\- Procurement Systems



Parmana ensures that every protected action is authorized before execution.



\---



\## Security Principle



```text

No Authorization



↓



No Execution

```



This is the most fundamental invariant of Execution Governance.

\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/44-direct-api-bypass/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Next Tutorial



\*\*Tutorial 45 — Connector Bypass\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates that even if an enterprise connector is compromised, it still cannot perform sensitive actions without passing through Parmana's Execution Gateway.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Enterprise APIs should never be invoked directly.

\- Every protected request must carry an Execution Authorization.

\- The Execution Gateway enforces this boundary.

\- Requests without authorization are rejected before reaching enterprise systems.
