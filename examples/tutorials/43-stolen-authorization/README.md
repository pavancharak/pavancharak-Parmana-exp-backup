\# Tutorial 43 — Stolen Authorization



\## Overview



An attacker may obtain a legitimate Execution Authorization.



Possession alone, however, does \*\*not\*\* grant permission to execute arbitrary requests.



Every Execution Authorization is cryptographically bound to the exact executable content that Parmana approved.



Changing the request invalidates the authorization.

\## Attack Scenario



```text

Attacker steals

Execution Authorization



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Changes payment amount



25,000 USD

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

500,000 USD



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Gateway



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Recompute Executable Content Hash



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Hash Mismatch



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



✗ Execution Rejected

```



\---



\## Original Request



```text

Action



release-payment



Target



sap.payment.release



Amount



25,000 USD

```



\---



\## Stolen Authorization



The attacker possesses a completely valid authorization.



```text

✓ Valid Signature



✓ Valid Policy



✓ Valid Authorization

```



But then changes the request.



```text

Amount



25,000 USD



↓



500,000 USD

```



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 43 - Stolen Authorization

==================================================



✓ Valid Execution Authorization generated.



Authorization Binding

\--------------------------------------------------



Authorized Hash : 4b7761f6...



Presented Hash  : 92afde17...



✓ Stolen authorization detected.



Execution rejected.



Tutorial completed successfully.

```



\---



\## Why This Works



The gateway never trusts the request itself.



Instead it:



1\. Rebuilds the executable content.

2\. Computes its hash.

3\. Compares it with the hash stored inside the authorization.



If they differ, execution stops.



\---



\## Security Guarantee



A stolen authorization is only valid for:



\- the original transaction

\- the original action

\- the original target

\- the original parameters



It cannot be transferred to another request.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/43-stolen-authorization/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\*\*Tutorial 44 — Direct API Bypass\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates why enterprise APIs should reject requests that bypass Parmana entirely.

\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- A valid authorization can be stolen.

\- Possession alone does not grant execution rights.

\- Execution Authorization is bound to the original executable content.

\- Modified requests are rejected before enterprise execution.
