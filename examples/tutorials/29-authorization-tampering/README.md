\# Tutorial 29 — Authorization Tampering



\## Overview



In the previous tutorials we learned how Parmana generates, verifies, and protects Execution Authorizations from replay.



This tutorial demonstrates another important security property:



> \*\*A signed Execution Authorization cannot be modified.\*\*



Changing even a single field invalidates the cryptographic signature.

✗ Signature Verification Failed

```

\## Why Tamper Detection Matters



An attacker must never be able to modify:



\- Policy Version

\- Decision ID

\- Business Transaction ID

\- Expiration Time

\- Executable Content Hash



without detection.



Because the digital signature covers the complete authorization payload, any modification immediately invalidates the signature.



\---



\## Generating the Authorization



```ts

const { context } =

&#x20; await runtime.execute(transaction);



const authorization =

&#x20; context.authorization!;

```



\---



\## Tampering With the Payload



For demonstration purposes we modify the policy version after signing.



```ts

const tampered = {

&#x20; ...authorization,

&#x20; payload: {

&#x20;   ...authorization.payload,

&#x20;   policyVersion: "2.0.1",

&#x20; },

};

```



The signature is \*\*not regenerated\*\*.



\---



\## Verifying the Tampered Authorization



```ts

const result =

&#x20; await verifier.verify(

&#x20;   tampered,

&#x20;   publicKey,

&#x20; );

```



The verifier recomputes the canonical payload and compares it against the signed payload.



Because they no longer match, signature verification fails.



\---



\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 29 - Authorization Tampering

==================================================



Generating authorization...



✓ Authorization generated.



Authorization payload modified.



Verifying tampered authorization...



Valid               : false

Version Supported   : true

Signature Verified  : false

Not Expired         : true



✓ Tampering detected.



Tutorial completed successfully.

```



\---



\## Why Signature Verification Failed



Originally the authorization contained:



```text

Policy Version



2.0.0

```



After modification:



```text

Policy Version



2.0.1

```



Although only one value changed, the payload hash changed.



Since the signature was generated from the original payload, verification fails.



\---



\## Security Guarantees



Execution Authorization protects against unauthorized modification of:



\- Decision identifiers

\- Policy information

\- Business transaction identifiers

\- Authorization lifetime

\- Executable content



This guarantees that enterprise systems execute exactly what Parmana authorized.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/29-authorization-tampering/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Next Tutorial



\*\*Tutorial 30 — Policy Version Pinning\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates why enterprise systems must reject Execution Authorizations that reference an unexpected policy version, even when the authorization itself is otherwise valid.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Execution Authorizations are immutable.

\- Digital signatures protect the complete authorization payload.

\- Modifying even a single field invalidates the signature.

\- Tampering is detected before enterprise execution begins.
