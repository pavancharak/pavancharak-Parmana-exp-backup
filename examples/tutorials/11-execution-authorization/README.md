\# Tutorial 11 — Execution Authorization



\## Objective



This tutorial demonstrates how Parmana issues a cryptographically signed

Execution Authorization after a Business Transaction has been approved.



The Execution Authorization proves that Parmana authorized a specific

execution request. It is intended to be verified by downstream execution

systems before any business action is performed.



\---



\## What You Will Learn



\- How an approved Decision produces an Execution Authorization.

\- What information is included in the authorization.

\- How the authorization is cryptographically signed.

\- How the authorization is attached to an Execution Request.

\- Why nonce and expiration protect against replay attacks.

\- Authorization ID

\- Decision ID

\- Business Transaction ID

\- Policy Name

\- Policy Version

\- Single-use Nonce

\- Authorized Time

\- Expiration Time

generated Signed Execution Authorization, demonstrating the information

that downstream execution systems use to verify Parmana's approval before

performing any business action.
