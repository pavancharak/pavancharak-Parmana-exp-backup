\# Tutorial 45 — Connector Bypass



\## Overview



Enterprise connectors simplify communication with external business systems.



However, \*\*connectors are not trusted security boundaries\*\*.



A connector must never be able to execute sensitive operations simply because it has network access to an enterprise system.



Parmana requires every connector request to carry a valid Execution Authorization.

Connector

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

Execution Gateway

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

Enterprise System

```



The connector forwards requests.



The Execution Gateway decides whether execution is permitted.



\---



\## Attack Scenario



A compromised connector attempts to call the enterprise system directly.



```text

Compromised Connector



&#x20;       │



Calls ERP API



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



No Execution Authorization



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Gateway



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



✗ Authorization Missing



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Rejected

```

\## Legitimate Flow



```text

Business Transaction



↓



Policy Evaluation



↓



Execution Authorization



↓



Connector



↓



Execution Gateway



↓



Enterprise Execution

```



The connector never authorizes execution.



It only transports an already-authorized request.

\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 45 - Connector Bypass

==================================================



Trusted Connector

\--------------------------------------------------



✓ Valid Execution Authorization present.



Compromised Connector

\--------------------------------------------------



✗ Connector omitted Execution Authorization.



Gateway rejected the request.



Reason:



Connectors cannot bypass pre-execution authorization.



Tutorial completed successfully.

```

\## Why This Matters



Enterprise environments often contain many connectors:



\- SAP Connectors

\- Oracle Connectors

\- Salesforce Connectors

\- Workday Connectors

\- Custom REST Integrations



If one connector is compromised, it must not become a path around governance.



\---



\## Security Principle



```text

Connector



≠



Trust Boundary

```



The Execution Gateway—not the connector—is the enforcement point.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/45-connector-bypass/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

The final tutorial demonstrates how Parmana protects against Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use attacks by re-verifying the executable content immediately before execution.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Connectors are transport mechanisms, not security boundaries.

\- Every connector request must carry a valid Execution Authorization.

\- The Execution Gateway independently verifies every request.

\- A compromised connector cannot bypass pre-execution authorization.
