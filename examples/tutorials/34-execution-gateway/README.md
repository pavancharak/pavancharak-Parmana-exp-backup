\# Tutorial 34 — Execution Gateway



\## Overview



This tutorial concludes the Parmana tutorial series.



The \*\*Execution Gateway\*\* is the final enforcement point before an enterprise action is performed.



Its responsibility is simple:



> Only execution requests carrying a valid Execution Authorization are allowed to reach enterprise systems.



Everything else is rejected.

\## Why an Execution Gateway?



Without a gateway, AI systems could communicate directly with enterprise applications.

There would be no centralized point to verify whether execution was authorized.



The Execution Gateway introduces a mandatory verification layer.

\## Responsibilities



The Execution Gateway validates that:



\- the Execution Authorization exists

\- the digital signature is valid

\- the authorization has not expired

\- the authorization belongs to the executable request

\- the expected policy version is being used

\- the authorization has not been replayed



Only after every validation succeeds is the request forwarded to the enterprise system.

\## Relationship to Previous Tutorials



Earlier tutorials introduced individual security controls:



\- Execution Authorization

\- Authorization Verification

\- Authorization Expiration

\- Replay Detection

\- Authorization Tampering

\- Policy Version Pinning

\- Authorization Binding

\- Runtime Pipeline

\- Execution Boundary



The Execution Gateway combines those controls into a single enforcement point before enterprise execution.



\---



\## Security Model



Every execution request must satisfy all required checks before it reaches an enterprise system.

\## Canonical Execution Governance Model



Parmana separates intelligence from execution.



```text

AI proposes

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Parmana authorizes

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution Gateway verifies

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Enterprise systems execute

```



This separation ensures that enterprise systems never execute AI-generated requests directly. Every execution must first pass through Parmana's governance and verification process.
