\# Tutorial 18 — Runtime Hooks



\## Overview



This tutorial demonstrates how to observe the Parmana Runtime lifecycle using Runtime Hooks.



Runtime Hooks allow developers to:



\- Log execution events

\- Measure performance

\- Export metrics

\- Send notifications

\- Integrate observability platforms



Hooks \*\*observe\*\* execution only.



They \*\*must never modify\*\* Runtime state.



If execution behavior must change, use \*\*Runtime Components\*\* instead.

\## Creating a Hook



Implement the `RuntimeHook` interface.



Example:



```ts

export class LoggingHook implements RuntimeHook {

&#x20; async beforePolicyLoad() {

&#x20;   console.log("Loading policy...");

&#x20; }

}

```



\---



\## Registering Hooks



```ts

const runtime =

&#x20; new RuntimeBuilder()

&#x20;   .addHook(new LoggingHook())

&#x20;   .addHook(new MetricsHook())

&#x20;   .build(repository);

```



Hooks execute sequentially in the order they are registered.



\---



\## Included Hooks



\### LoggingHook



Demonstrates observing every Runtime lifecycle event.



\### MetricsHook



Measures the duration of each Runtime phase.



\---



\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/18-runtime-hooks/run.ts

```



\---



\## Expected Output



```

\[Hook] Loading policy...

\[Metrics] Policy Load: 1.21 ms



\[Hook] Evaluating policy...

\[Metrics] Policy Evaluation: 0.42 ms



\[Hook] Building Decision artifact.

\[Metrics] Decision: 0.15 ms



\[Hook] Signing execution authorization.

\[Metrics] Authorization: 1.84 ms



\[Hook] Executing runtime pipeline.

\[Metrics] Runtime Pipeline: 2.08 ms



\[Hook] Building Execution Trust Record.

\[Metrics] Trust Pipeline: 0.76 ms

```

\## Runtime Hooks vs Runtime Components



| Runtime Hooks | Runtime Components |

|---------------|--------------------|

| Observe execution | Modify execution |

| Logging | Signal enrichment |

| Metrics | Context transformation |

| Tracing | Validation |

| Notifications | Policy-aware processing |

| Auditing | Runtime customization |



\---



\## Summary



Runtime Hooks provide a safe, extensible mechanism for observing the complete Parmana Runtime lifecycle without affecting deterministic execution.
