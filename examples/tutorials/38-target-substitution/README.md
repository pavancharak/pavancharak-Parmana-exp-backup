\# Tutorial 38 — Target Substitution



\## Overview



Target substitution is an attack where a valid Execution Authorization is reused against a different execution target than the one Parmana originally approved.



For example, an authorization issued for:



```

sap.payment.release

```



must never be accepted for:



```

oracle.payment.release

```



Parmana prevents this by including the execution target in the executable content hash.

\## Attack Scenario



```text

Authorized Request



Action



release-payment



Target



sap.payment.release



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Authorization



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Attacker changes target



sap.payment.release

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

oracle.payment.release



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Gateway recomputes executable hash



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



✗ Hash Mismatch



&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼



Execution Rejected

```



\---



\## Original Request



```text

Action



release-payment



Target



sap.payment.release



Parameters



invoiceId

vendorId

paymentAmount

currency

```



\---



\## Modified Request



```text

Action



release-payment



Target



oracle.payment.release



Parameters



invoiceId

vendorId

paymentAmount

currency

```



Only the execution target changed.



That single modification changes the executable content hash.

\## Expected Output



```text

==================================================

Tutorial 38 - Target Substitution

==================================================



Authorized Target



sap.payment.release



Substituted Target



oracle.payment.release



Original Hash

Substituted Hash

✓ Target substitution detected.



Execution rejected.

\## Why This Matters



A valid authorization for one enterprise system must never be accepted by another.



Examples include:



\- SAP → Oracle

\- Oracle → Workday

\- Payment API → Vendor API

\- Production → Sandbox



Execution Authorization prevents these attacks because the execution target is cryptographically bound to the authorization.



\---



\## Protected Fields



The executable content includes:



\- businessTransactionId

\- action

\- target

\- parameters



Changing any field changes the executable content hash.

\## Running the Example



```bash

tsx examples/tutorials/38-target-substitution/run.ts

```



or



```bash

npm run examples

```

\## Next Tutorial



\*\*Tutorial 39 — Policy Substitution\*\*



The next tutorial demonstrates why a valid authorization issued under one policy version cannot be reused under another policy.



\---



\## Summary



In this tutorial you learned:



\- Execution Authorization is bound to the execution target.

\- Changing the target changes the executable content hash.

\- The gateway detects the mismatch.

\- Target substitution is rejected before enterprise execution.
