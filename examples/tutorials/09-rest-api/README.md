\# Tutorial 09 — REST API



\## Overview



This tutorial demonstrates how to interact with Parmana through its REST API.



Instead of calling the Runtime directly, a client submits a Business Transaction over HTTP. The API executes the transaction and returns the resulting Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Learning Objectives



After completing this tutorial you will understand:



\- Parmana REST API

\- HTTP Requests

\- Business Transaction Submission

\- Execution Trust Record Response

\## Prerequisites



The server enforces caller authentication on every route except `/health`. Either start it with `PARMANA_AUTH_DISABLED=true` (local development only, never in a real deployment), or set `PARMANA_API_KEY` to a raw key generated via `npm run generate:api-key` before running this tutorial. See \[Authentication]\(/api-reference/authentication).



\---



\## Run



```bash

npm run example -- 09-rest-api

```



or



```bash

tsx run.ts

```



\---



\## Expected Output



The tutorial prints:



\- HTTP Request

\- HTTP Response

\- Execution Trust Record
