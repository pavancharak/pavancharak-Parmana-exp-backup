# \# Scenario — Purchase Order

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# This scenario demonstrates an enterprise Purchase Order approval workflow using Parmana.

# 

# A requester submits a Purchase Order, an authorized procurement manager approves it, Parmana evaluates the Purchase Order Policy, executes the transaction, verifies the resulting Execution Trust Record, and generates a Receipt.

# 

# This scenario represents a common enterprise procurement workflow.
