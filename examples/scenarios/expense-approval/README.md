# \# Scenario — Expense Approval

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# This scenario demonstrates an employee expense reimbursement workflow using Parmana.

# 

# An employee submits an expense report, a manager authorizes reimbursement, Parmana evaluates the Expense Approval Policy, executes the transaction, verifies the resulting Execution Trust Record, and generates a Receipt.

# 

# This scenario represents a common enterprise finance workflow.
