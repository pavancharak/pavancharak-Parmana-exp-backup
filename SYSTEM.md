\# Parmana



\*\*Human Authority for Enterprise AI\*\*



\## Overview



Parmana is an Execution Authorization and Verification Infrastructure for Enterprise AI. It enables organizations to deploy autonomous AI while ensuring that every high-impact action is authorized, policy-compliant, verifiable, and auditable.



Unlike systems that rely on trusting AI outputs, Parmana evaluates execution requests using trusted execution signals and organizational policy before any action is allowed to occur.



\---



\# Vision



The future is not AI that simply answers questions.



The future is AI that organizations trust to perform real work.



Parmana provides the trust infrastructure required for AI systems to execute actions responsibly inside enterprises.



\---



\# Problem Statement



Modern AI systems are increasingly capable of making decisions and performing work. However, organizations cannot safely allow AI to execute business operations without answering critical questions:



\* Is the action permitted?

\* Does it comply with company policy?

\* Has the required human approval been obtained?

\* Is the action based on verified enterprise data?

\* Can the decision be independently audited later?



Without these guarantees, autonomous AI cannot be safely deployed in regulated or high-impact environments.



\---



\# Solution



Parmana acts as an independent execution authority positioned between AI systems and enterprise systems.



Every execution request is evaluated against:



\* Organizational policies

\* Enterprise facts

\* Human approvals

\* AI-derived signals

\* Governance rules

\* Risk controls



Only actions that satisfy all authorization requirements are approved for execution.



\---



\# Core Principle



AI may propose actions.



Parmana determines whether those actions are authorized to execute.



AI intelligence and execution authority are intentionally separated.



\---



\# Design Principles



\## Trust Through Verification



Parmana never assumes an AI response is correct.



Every execution request is verified using trusted evidence.



\---



\## Human Authority



Organizations retain ultimate authority over business operations.



Human approval can be mandatory whenever required by policy.



\---



\## Policy First



Policies determine what may execute.



AI capability never overrides organizational policy.



\---



\## Deterministic Verification



Given the same execution request, policies, enterprise facts, and approvals, Parmana produces the same authorization result.



\---



\## Independent Auditability



Every authorization decision produces evidence that can be independently verified without relying on the original AI system.

\# System Components



\## Runtime



Coordinates the complete authorization workflow from request reception to final execution decision.



Responsibilities include:



\* Request validation

\* Policy evaluation

\* Signal collection

\* Authorization

\* Receipt generation

\* Audit logging



\---



\## Policy Engine



Evaluates organizational policies.



Examples include:



\* Spending limits

\* Separation of duties

\* Required approvals

\* Regulatory constraints

\* Business rules

\* Compliance requirements



\---



\## Signal Evaluation Engine



Collects trusted execution signals.



Signals are divided into three categories.



\### Enterprise Facts



Deterministic information retrieved from systems of record.



Examples:



\* Employee role

\* Budget availability

\* Purchase order status

\* Customer account state

\* Identity verification

\* Access permissions



\---



\### AI-Derived Signals



Information produced by AI models.



Examples:



\* Classification

\* Risk score

\* Intent detection

\* Sentiment analysis

\* Document extraction



AI-derived signals are treated as evidence rather than authority.



\---



\### Human Authority Signals



Explicit organizational approvals.



Examples:



\* Manager approval

\* Executive authorization

\* Compliance sign-off

\* Manual override

\* Emergency approval



\---



\## Authorization Engine



Combines:



\* Policy rules

\* Enterprise facts

\* AI-derived signals

\* Human approvals



to determine whether execution is permitted.



Possible outcomes:



\* Approved

\* Rejected

\* Escalated

\* Awaiting Approval



\---



\## Verification Engine



Confirms that:



\* Policies were evaluated

\* Required approvals exist

\* Evidence is complete

\* Execution request has not been modified

\* Authorization decision is reproducible



\---



\## Cryptography Layer



Provides integrity protection using:



\* SHA-256 hashing

\* Ed25519 digital signatures



This ensures receipts and execution records cannot be altered without detection.



\---



\## Receipt Generator



Every authorization decision produces a receipt containing:



\* Request ID

\* Decision

\* Timestamp

\* Policy version

\* Signal summary

\* Approval evidence

\* Cryptographic hash

\* Digital signature



Receipts provide independent proof of authorization.



\---



\## Audit System



Stores immutable execution records.



Audit records include:



\* Request details

\* Policy evaluation

\* Signals used

\* Human approvals

\* Authorization result

\* Verification outcome

\* Receipt reference



These records support regulatory compliance, forensic analysis, and operational transparency.



\---



\# Execution Flow



1\. AI submits an execution request.

2\. Parmana validates the request.

3\. Enterprise facts are collected.

4\. AI-derived signals are evaluated.

5\. Required human approvals are verified.

6\. Policies are executed.

7\. Authorization decision is produced.

8\. Verification confirms decision integrity.

9\. Receipt is generated and signed.

10\. Approved actions are executed.

11\. Audit record is stored.



\---



\# Security Model



Parmana follows a zero-trust execution model.



Key security principles include:



\* Never trust AI assertions without verification.

\* Verify enterprise facts from systems of record.

\* Require human approval where mandated.

\* Sign authorization receipts cryptographically.

\* Maintain immutable audit records.

\* Separate execution authority from AI reasoning.

\# Guiding Principle



Before Parmana, AI assists people.



After Parmana, AI performs policy-compliant work.



Organizations do not trust AI because it is intelligent.



They trust AI because every action is authorized, verified, and supported by independent evidence.
