\# Trust Model



\## Purpose



This document defines the \*\*Parmana Trust Model\*\*, the conceptual framework that explains how trust is established, maintained, and verified throughout the authorization lifecycle.



The Trust Model is the foundation upon which Parmana is designed. It explains why organizations can trust execution performed by AI systems without trusting the AI systems themselves.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Introduction



Enterprise AI introduces a fundamental challenge.



Organizations increasingly want AI systems to perform operational work, but they cannot safely delegate execution authority based solely on AI capability.



The central question is not:



> \*\*"Can AI perform this task?"\*\*



The central question is:



> \*\*"Can the organization trust the execution of this task?"\*\*



Parmana answers this question by establishing trust through independent authorization and verification.



\---



\# Trust Is Not Confidence



Parmana distinguishes between \*\*confidence\*\* and \*\*trust\*\*.



AI confidence represents how certain a model is about its own output.



Trust represents the organization's confidence that execution complies with its policies, governance, and authority.



These concepts are fundamentally different.



| AI Confidence                  | Execution Trust                        |

| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |

| Model-generated                | Organization-established               |

| Probabilistic                  | Evidence-based                         |

| AI-specific                    | Technology-independent                 |

| Describes prediction certainty | Describes authorization validity       |

| Cannot authorize execution     | Determines whether execution may occur |



Parmana is concerned with execution trust—not model confidence.



\---



\# Trust Through Verification



The Parmana Trust Model is built on one principle:



> \*\*Trust is established through verification, not assumption.\*\*



Execution is trusted because Parmana verifies:



\* Organizational policy

\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority

\* Required approvals

\* Authorization conditions

\* Cryptographic integrity



Trust results from verified evidence.



\---



\# Sources of Trust



Parmana establishes trust using three categories of evidence.



\## Enterprise Facts



Enterprise Facts originate from authoritative systems of record.



Examples include:



\* Identity

\* Financial information

\* Organizational hierarchy

\* Purchase orders

\* Budget availability



Enterprise Facts establish objective business reality.



\---



\## Human Authority



Organizations retain ultimate execution authority.



Human Authority is expressed through:



\* Organizational policy

\* Delegated authority

\* Required approvals

\* Governance rules



Parmana preserves this authority during every authorization decision.



\---



\## AI-Derived Signals



AI systems contribute valuable evidence.



Examples include:



\* Risk assessments

\* Intent detection

\* Fraud analysis

\* Recommendations



These signals assist authorization.



They never become the source of authority.



\---



\# Separation of Responsibilities



Parmana separates four distinct responsibilities.



```text id="59pl5q"

AI System

│

├── Understand

├── Recommend

└── Propose

&#x20;        │

&#x20;        ▼

Parmana

│

├── Verify

├── Authorize

└── Record

&#x20;        │

&#x20;        ▼

Execution System

│

└── Execute

```



This separation prevents AI systems from authorizing their own actions.



\---



\# Trust Lifecycle



Trust is established through the following lifecycle.



```text id="2ofxof"

Business Transaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Request

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Policy Reference

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Signal Collection

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Authority Verification

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Authorization Decision

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Receipt

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Independent Verification

```



Each stage contributes to establishing trust.



\---



\# Trust Boundaries



Parmana defines clear trust boundaries.



\## AI Boundary



AI systems are trusted to generate recommendations.



They are not trusted to authorize execution.



\---



\## Policy Boundary



Organizational policy defines authorization rules.



Policy determines the conditions under which execution is permitted.



\---



\## Verification Boundary



Only verified evidence participates in authorization.



Unverified information is excluded.



\---



\## Execution Boundary



Execution occurs only after successful authorization.



Execution systems do not reinterpret authorization decisions.



\---



\## Audit Boundary



Independent verification remains possible after execution has completed.



\---



\# Evidence-Based Trust



Authorization decisions are based exclusively on recorded evidence.



Evidence includes:



\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Policy evaluation

\* Execution Context



Every authorization decision can be explained using recorded evidence.



\---



\# Independent Trust



Trust should not depend upon:



\* The AI model

\* The requesting application

\* The execution system

\* Runtime memory

\* Operator interpretation



Instead, trust is derived from independently verifiable authorization evidence.



\---



\# Cryptographic Trust



Parmana protects trust artifacts using cryptographic integrity mechanisms.



Integrity protection enables verification that:



\* records have not been modified,

\* receipts are authentic,

\* authorization evidence remains intact.



Cryptography protects trust.



It does not establish authority.



Authority originates from organizational governance.



\---



\# Replayable Trust



Trust should remain reproducible over time.



Given the:



\* Execution Request,

\* governing policy,

\* recorded evidence,



Parmana should reproduce the same Authorization Decision.



Replay demonstrates that trust remains valid.



\---



\# Trust Relationships

Trust flows from organizational authority—not from AI capability.

\# Design Principles



The Parmana Trust Model follows these principles.



\## Trust is evidence-based.



Authorization depends upon verified evidence.



\---



\## Authority is organizational.



Organizations determine execution authority.



\---



\## AI assists authorization.



AI contributes evidence but does not grant authority.



\---



\## Policies govern execution.



Authorization follows explicit organizational policy.



\---



\## Verification precedes execution.



Execution never occurs before Authority Verification completes.



\---



\## Authorization is deterministic.



Equivalent inputs produce equivalent Authorization Decisions.



\---



\## Evidence is immutable.



Authorization evidence is permanently preserved.



\---



\## Trust is independently verifiable.



Verification does not require trusting the original AI system.



\---



\# What the Trust Model Is Not



The Parmana Trust Model is \*\*not\*\*:



\* an AI safety framework,

\* a machine learning model,

\* a workflow engine,

\* an identity system,

\* a policy language,

\* an execution platform.



It is the conceptual framework describing how execution trust is established and maintained.



\---



\# Guarantees



Parmana provides the following trust guarantees.



\* Trust originates from organizational governance.

\* AI systems never authorize their own execution.

\* Organizational policy governs every Authorization Decision.

\* Enterprise Facts remain authoritative.

\* Human Authority remains the ultimate source of execution authority.

\* Authorization evidence is permanently preserved.

\* Execution Trust Records are immutable.

\* Execution Receipts are independently verifiable.

\* Authorization decisions are deterministic and replayable.

\* Trust remains independent of AI implementation.



\---



\# Summary



The Parmana Trust Model explains why organizations can trust autonomous AI execution without trusting autonomous AI itself.



Trust is not derived from model capability, confidence scores, or AI reasoning.



Trust is established through organizational authority, explicit policy, verified evidence, deterministic authorization, immutable records, and independent verification.



By separating intelligence from authority and verification from execution, Parmana enables organizations to deploy autonomous AI while retaining governance, accountability, and control over every high-impact business operation.
