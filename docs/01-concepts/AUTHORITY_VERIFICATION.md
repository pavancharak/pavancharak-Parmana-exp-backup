\# Authority Verification



\## Purpose



This document defines \*\*Authority Verification\*\*, the core authorization process of the Parmana Runtime.



Authority Verification determines whether an Execution Request is authorized to execute according to organizational policy, verified evidence, and required human authority.



It is the central function of Parmana and represents the point at which organizational governance is enforced before execution.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Definition



\*\*Authority Verification\*\* is the deterministic process of evaluating an Execution Request against the governing organizational policy using verified evidence to produce an Authorization Decision.



Authority Verification determines \*\*whether execution is permitted\*\*.



It does not perform the execution itself.



\---



\# Role Within Parmana



Parmana separates the responsibilities of proposing work, authorizing work, and executing work.

Authority Verification is the decision boundary between \*\*intent\*\* and \*\*execution\*\*.



\---



\# Objectives



Authority Verification has four primary objectives:



1\. Evaluate organizational policy.

2\. Verify trusted evidence.

3\. Confirm required human authority.

4\. Produce a deterministic Authorization Decision.



\---



\# Inputs



Authority Verification evaluates the following inputs:



\## Execution Request



The structured request describing the intended Business Transaction.



See:



\* `EXECUTION\_REQUEST.md`



\---



\## Policy Reference



Identifies the governing organizational policy.



See:



\* `POLICY\_REFERENCE.md`



\---



\## Policy Definition



The organizational policy identified by the Policy Reference.



The policy specifies:



\* Authorization rules

\* Required approvals

\* Required evidence

\* Constraints

\* Compliance requirements



\---



\## Signals



Evidence collected for evaluation.



Signals include:



\* Enterprise Facts

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Human Authority Signals



See:



\* `SIGNAL\_MODEL.md`



\---



\## Execution Context



Context describing the environment in which authorization occurs.



Examples include:



\* Organization

\* Environment

\* Tenant

\* Timestamp

\* Identity

\* Request origin



\---



\# Verification Process



Authority Verification consists of the following logical stages.



```text

Execution Request

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Validate Request

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Resolve Policy

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Collect Signals

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Validate Signals

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Evaluate Policy

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Determine Authorization

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Produce Authorization Decision

```



Each stage is deterministic.



\---



\# Stage 1 — Request Validation



The Runtime validates that:



\* the request is well formed,

\* required fields are present,

\* identifiers are valid,

\* the request is internally consistent.



Requests that fail validation do not proceed to authorization.



\---



\# Stage 2 — Policy Resolution



The Runtime resolves the Policy Reference to the corresponding organizational policy.



Policy resolution determines:



\* which rules apply,

\* required evidence,

\* approval requirements,

\* authorization conditions.



Policy selection is explicit.



The Runtime never guesses the applicable policy.



\---



\# Stage 3 — Signal Collection



The Runtime collects the evidence required by the policy.



Examples include:



\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Approvals

\* AI-Derived Signals



Only signals required by the governing policy are evaluated.



\---



\# Stage 4 — Signal Validation



Collected signals are validated before policy evaluation.



Validation includes:



\* source verification,

\* integrity validation,

\* completeness,

\* schema validation,

\* freshness,

\* identity validation where applicable.



Invalid evidence is rejected.



\---



\# Stage 5 — Policy Evaluation



The Runtime evaluates the validated evidence against the organizational policy.



Evaluation determines whether:



\* required approvals exist,

\* required Enterprise Facts satisfy policy,

\* mandatory constraints are satisfied,

\* execution conditions are met.



Policy evaluation produces an authorization outcome.



\---



\# Stage 6 — Authorization Decision



The result of Authority Verification is an Authorization Decision.



Typical outcomes include:



\* Approved

\* Rejected

\* Awaiting Approval

\* Escalated



The Authorization Decision is defined separately in:



\* `DECISION\_MODEL.md`



\---



\# Determinism



Authority Verification is deterministic.



Given identical:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Definition

\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Execution Context



the Runtime should produce the same Authorization Decision.



Determinism enables:



\* Replay

\* Independent verification

\* Regression testing

\* Compliance review

\* Audit



\---



\# Verification Rules



Authority Verification follows these principles.



\## Policy Governs Authorization



Execution is authorized only according to organizational policy.



\---



\## Evidence Precedes Decision



Authorization is based on verified evidence.



Assumptions are never sufficient.



\---



\## Human Authority Is Preserved



Where policy requires human approval, execution cannot proceed until the required authority has been verified.



\---



\## Enterprise Facts Are Authoritative



Enterprise systems remain the source of truth for organizational information.



\---



\## AI Supports but Does Not Authorize



AI-Derived Signals contribute evidence.



They never independently authorize execution.



\---



\# Failure Conditions



Authority Verification may fail when:



\* Policy cannot be resolved.

\* Required evidence is missing.

\* Required approvals are absent.

\* Enterprise Facts violate policy.

\* Identity validation fails.

\* Signal integrity cannot be verified.

\* Policy evaluation rejects execution.



Failure does not imply a Runtime error.



It represents an authorization outcome.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution Trust Record



Every completed Authority Verification produces an Execution Trust Record.



The record contains:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Reference

\* Policy version

\* Evaluated signals

\* Authorization Decision

\* Verification metadata



The Execution Trust Record preserves the complete authorization evidence.



\---



\# Relationship to Replay



Replay re-executes Authority Verification using the recorded evidence.



Successful replay demonstrates that the authorization decision remains reproducible.



\---



\# Security Considerations



Authority Verification protects against:



\* unauthorized execution,

\* policy bypass,

\* evidence tampering,

\* forged approvals,

\* identity spoofing,

\* incomplete authorization.



All authorization decisions are based on verified evidence.



\---



\# Design Principles



Authority Verification follows these principles:



\* Deterministic.

\* Evidence-driven.

\* Policy-governed.

\* Human-authorized.

\* Independently verifiable.

\* Replayable.

\* Auditable.

\* Technology-independent.



\---



\# What Authority Verification Is Not



Authority Verification is \*\*not\*\*:



\* execution,

\* workflow orchestration,

\* AI reasoning,

\* policy authoring,

\* identity management,

\* business process automation.



Its responsibility is limited to determining whether execution is authorized.



\---



\# Guarantees



Parmana provides the following guarantees:



\* Every Execution Request undergoes Authority Verification before execution.

\* Every authorization decision is governed by an explicit Policy Reference.

\* Authorization decisions are based on verified evidence.

\* Human Authority requirements are enforced.

\* Enterprise Facts remain authoritative.

\* AI-Derived Signals never independently authorize execution.

\* Every completed verification produces an Execution Trust Record.

\* Authorization decisions are deterministic and suitable for replay and audit.



\---



\# Summary



Authority Verification is the core authorization mechanism of Parmana.



It transforms an Execution Request into an Authorization Decision by evaluating organizational policy against verified evidence while preserving Human Authority.



By separating authorization from execution, Parmana enables organizations to deploy autonomous AI systems without relinquishing governance, accountability, or control over high-impact business operations.
