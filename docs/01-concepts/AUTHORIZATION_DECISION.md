\# Authorization Decision



\## Purpose



This document defines the \*\*Authorization Decision\*\*, the canonical outcome produced by Authority Verification.



An Authorization Decision represents Parmana's determination of whether an Execution Request is permitted to proceed according to organizational policy, verified evidence, and required human authority.



It is the authoritative decision that controls execution.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Definition



An \*\*Authorization Decision\*\* is the deterministic outcome of Authority Verification.



It expresses the organization's decision regarding an Execution Request.



An Authorization Decision determines whether execution:



\* may proceed,

\* must be denied,

\* requires additional approval,

\* or must be escalated.



The Authorization Decision is produced before any execution occurs.



\---



\# Purpose



The Authorization Decision separates \*\*authorization\*\* from \*\*execution\*\*.



Its responsibilities are to:



\* Express the authorization outcome.

\* Record the basis for the decision.

\* Control whether execution is permitted.

\* Provide evidence for replay and audit.

\* Produce a consistent interface for execution systems.



Parmana authorizes actions.



Execution systems perform actions.



\---



\# Position in the Execution Lifecycle



The Authorization Decision is produced after Authority Verification and before execution.

```



It is the control point that determines whether execution may continue.



\---



\# Inputs



An Authorization Decision is derived from:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Reference

\* Policy Definition

\* Enterprise Facts

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Human Authority Signals

\* Execution Context



No other information influences the decision.



\---



\# Decision Outcomes



Parmana defines four canonical outcomes.



\## Approved



Execution is authorized.



All required policy conditions have been satisfied.



The execution system may proceed.



\---



\## Rejected



Execution is denied.



One or more policy requirements were not satisfied.



No execution is permitted.



\---



\## Awaiting Approval



Execution cannot continue because one or more required Human Approvals have not yet been obtained.



The request may be resubmitted after the required approvals are available.



\---



\## Escalated



Execution requires review outside the normal authorization path.



Examples include:



\* Policy conflicts

\* Exceptional risk

\* Regulatory review

\* Manual investigation



Execution remains blocked until the escalation is resolved.



\---



\# Decision Characteristics



Every Authorization Decision is:



\* Deterministic

\* Explicit

\* Immutable

\* Independently verifiable

\* Auditable

\* Replayable



These properties are fundamental to Parmana.



\---



\# Decision Contents



Conceptually, an Authorization Decision consists of:



```text

Authorization Decision

├── Decision Identifier

├── Decision Outcome

├── Policy Reference

├── Policy Version

├── Verification Status

├── Decision Timestamp

└── Evidence Reference

```



The physical representation is implementation-specific.



\---



\# Decision Basis



Authorization Decisions are based exclusively on verified evidence.



Evidence may include:



\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Policy evaluation results

\* Execution Context



AI confidence alone is never sufficient.



\---



\# Relationship to Human Authority



Human Authority remains the source of execution authority.



The Authorization Decision records whether the required authority has been satisfied.



It does not create new authority.



\---



\# Relationship to Policy



Every Authorization Decision references the governing organizational policy.



This enables:



\* Replay

\* Audit

\* Independent verification

\* Historical analysis



Authorization decisions remain understandable even after policies evolve.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution



Execution systems consume Authorization Decisions.



Execution systems do not reinterpret policy.



They simply respect the authorization outcome.

\---



\# Relationship to Execution Trust Record



Every Authorization Decision becomes part of the Execution Trust Record.



The record preserves:



\* Decision outcome

\* Evidence evaluated

\* Governing policy

\* Verification metadata

\* Decision timestamp



This allows the decision to be independently verified in the future.



\---



\# Immutability



Once issued, an Authorization Decision MUST NOT be modified.



If business circumstances change, a new Execution Request must be submitted and a new Authorization Decision produced.



Historical decisions remain permanent.



\---



\# Determinism



Authorization Decisions are deterministic.



Given identical:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Definition

\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Execution Context



Parmana will produce the same Authorization Decision.



This property enables replay and independent verification.



\---



\# Security Considerations



Authorization Decisions should be protected against:



\* Modification

\* Forgery

\* Substitution

\* Unauthorized deletion

\* Replay attacks



Integrity protection is provided by the Execution Trust Record and associated cryptographic mechanisms.



\---



\# Design Principles



Authorization Decisions follow these principles:



\* Produced only after Authority Verification.

\* Based on verified evidence.

\* Governed by explicit policy.

\* Independent of AI reasoning.

\* Immutable once issued.

\* Suitable for replay.

\* Suitable for audit.

\* Technology-independent.



\---



\# What an Authorization Decision Is Not



An Authorization Decision is \*\*not\*\*:



\* a Business Transaction,

\* an Execution Request,

\* a workflow,

\* an execution log,

\* an AI recommendation,

\* a Human Approval,

\* an Organizational Policy.



It is the formal authorization outcome produced by Parmana.



\---



\# Guarantees



Parmana provides the following guarantees:



\* Every Authorization Decision is produced by Authority Verification.

\* Every decision references an explicit Policy Reference.

\* Every decision is supported by verified evidence.

\* Every decision is immutable.

\* Every decision is independently verifiable.

\* Every decision is suitable for replay.

\* Every decision becomes part of the Execution Trust Record.

\* Execution occurs only when the Authorization Decision is \*\*Approved\*\*.



\---



\# Summary



The Authorization Decision is the authoritative outcome of Parmana's authorization process.



It translates organizational policy and verified evidence into a deterministic execution decision while preserving human authority and organizational governance.



By separating authorization from execution, Parmana enables autonomous AI systems to perform real work without transferring execution authority away from the organization.
