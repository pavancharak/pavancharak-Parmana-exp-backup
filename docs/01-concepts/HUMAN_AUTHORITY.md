\# Human Authority



\## Purpose



This document defines the concept of \*\*Human Authority\*\* within Parmana.



Human Authority is the foundational principle that organizations—not AI systems—retain ultimate authority over business operations. Parmana preserves this authority by ensuring that every execution decision is governed by organizational policies, delegated authority, and explicit approvals where required.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Definition



\*\*Human Authority\*\* is the organizational authority delegated to people through governance, business responsibility, and organizational policy.



It determines:



\* Who may authorize business operations.

\* Which actions require approval.

\* Which responsibilities may be delegated.

\* Under what conditions execution is permitted.



Human Authority is the ultimate source of execution authority within Parmana.



\---



\# Core Principle



Parmana distinguishes between \*\*reasoning\*\* and \*\*authority\*\*.



AI systems may:



\* Analyze information.

\* Recommend actions.

\* Generate plans.

\* Propose execution.



Organizations determine whether those proposed actions may actually be executed.



The ability to recommend an action does not imply the authority to perform it.



\---



\# Organizational Authority



Every organization establishes authority through governance.



Examples include:



\* Financial approval hierarchies

\* Procurement policies

\* Identity and access policies

\* Security procedures

\* Regulatory requirements

\* Delegation matrices

\* Internal operating procedures



These governance mechanisms determine who is authorized to approve or reject a Business Transaction.



Parmana enforces these organizational decisions during execution authorization.



\---



\# Delegated Authority



Organizations frequently delegate authority to specific roles rather than individuals.



Examples include:



\* Finance Manager

\* Procurement Officer

\* Security Administrator

\* Department Head

\* Compliance Officer



Parmana evaluates whether the required delegated authority has been satisfied according to the applicable organizational policy.



The specific identity of an approver is less important than whether the approver possesses the required organizational authority.



\---



\# Human Approval



Some Business Transactions require explicit Human Approval before execution.



Examples include:



\* High-value financial payments

\* Privileged access requests

\* Regulatory filings

\* Customer data deletion

\* Infrastructure changes in production



Where required by policy, Human Approval is mandatory.



AI-generated recommendations cannot substitute for required human approval.



\---



\# Relationship to AI



AI systems participate in decision support but do not become the source of organizational authority.



AI may:



\* Recommend

\* Prioritize

\* Analyze

\* Classify

\* Detect risk

\* Estimate impact



AI may not independently redefine organizational authority.



Authority always originates from the organization.



\---



\# Relationship to Policy



Human Authority is expressed through Organizational Policies.



Policies define:



\* Approval requirements

\* Delegation rules

\* Authorization thresholds

\* Risk controls

\* Compliance obligations



Parmana evaluates execution requests against these policies to determine whether the required authority has been satisfied.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution Requests



Every Execution Request is evaluated in the context of Human Authority.



The Runtime determines:



\* Who initiated the request.

\* Which authority is required.

\* Whether required approvals exist.

\* Whether organizational policy permits execution.



Execution Requests do not grant authority.



They request authorization.



\---



\# Relationship to Authority Verification



Authority Verification confirms that the required Human Authority exists before execution.



The verification process may evaluate:



\* Organizational policies

\* Delegated authority

\* Approval records

\* Identity information

\* Enterprise Facts



Only after these requirements are satisfied may execution proceed.



\---



\# Relationship to Enterprise Facts



Human Authority relies on trusted enterprise information.



Examples include:



\* Employee role

\* Organizational hierarchy

\* Department membership

\* Approval limits

\* Employment status

\* Delegation assignments



These Enterprise Facts are obtained from authoritative Systems of Record.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution Trust Record



When authorization completes, the Execution Trust Record records the authority evaluated during the decision.



The record may include references to:



\* Applicable policy

\* Required authority

\* Approval evidence

\* Delegated role

\* Verification outcome



This provides a verifiable explanation of why execution was authorized or rejected.



\---



\# Separation of Responsibility



Parmana separates four distinct responsibilities:



```text

Business Need

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

AI Reasoning

(What should happen?)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Human Authority

(Who may approve?)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Policy Evaluation

(Under which rules?)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution

(What is allowed to happen?)

```



This separation ensures that AI capability never replaces organizational governance.



\---



\# Design Principles



Human Authority within Parmana follows these principles:



\* Organizations define authority.

\* AI does not grant itself authority.

\* Delegated authority follows organizational policy.

\* Human approvals are explicit.

\* Authority is independently verifiable.

\* Authority decisions are deterministic.

\* Authority is recorded for audit and replay.



\---



\# What Human Authority Is Not



Human Authority is \*\*not\*\*:



\* AI confidence

\* Model probability

\* AI reasoning

\* Workflow ownership

\* Application permissions alone

\* System configuration

\* Runtime state



It is an organizational governance concept.



\---



\# Guarantees



Parmana provides the following guarantees regarding Human Authority:



\* Execution authority always originates from the organization.

\* Required Human Approvals cannot be bypassed by AI reasoning.

\* Delegated authority is evaluated according to policy.

\* Authority verification is recorded in the Execution Trust Record.

\* Authority decisions are reproducible and auditable.



\---



\# Summary



Human Authority is the foundation of trusted AI execution in Parmana.



It ensures that organizations retain control over business operations by separating AI reasoning from execution authority.



AI may propose actions, but organizations decide whether those actions may be executed. Parmana enforces that decision through policy-driven authorization, verified enterprise evidence, and explicit human approvals where required.
