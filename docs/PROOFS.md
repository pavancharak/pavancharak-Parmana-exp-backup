\# Parmana Proofs



Version: 1.0



Status: Evidence Registry



\---



\# Purpose



This document records the implementation evidence supporting each Parmana guarantee.



A guarantee is considered proven only when sufficient evidence exists across implementation, testing, audit, and independent verification.



This document serves as the evidence registry for the Parmana architecture.



\---



\# Proof Model



Every guarantee progresses through the following lifecycle.



```text

Specification

&#x20;     ↓

Implementation

&#x20;     ↓

Unit Tests

&#x20;     ↓

Integration Tests

&#x20;     ↓

Negative Tests

&#x20;     ↓

Audit

&#x20;     ↓

Independent Verification

&#x20;     ↓

Release

```



A guarantee SHOULD NOT be marked as proven until all applicable evidence has been completed.



\---



\# Evidence Types



\## Implementation



Source code implementing the guarantee.



\---



\## Unit Tests



Component-level validation.



\---



\## Integration Tests



End-to-end validation across packages.



\---



\## Negative Tests



Verification that invalid inputs or violations are rejected.



\---



\## Audit



Manual architectural review confirming that the implementation satisfies the intended guarantee.



\---



\## Independent Verification



Evidence can be validated without trusting the original runtime.

\# Proof Requirements



A guarantee may be promoted to \*\*Proven\*\* only when all of the following are satisfied:



\* Implementation complete

\* Unit tests passing

\* Integration tests passing

\* Negative tests passing

\* Architectural audit completed

\* Independent verification available (where applicable)



\---



\# Audit References



Architectural audits are maintained separately.



Examples:



\* AS-001 — Trusted Vendor Payment

\* Future audits covering additional execution scenarios



Audits provide qualitative evidence that complements automated testing.



\---



\# Independent Verification



Independent verification demonstrates that execution evidence can be validated without trusting the runtime that produced it.



Examples include:



\* Trust Record integrity verification

\* Receipt signature verification

\* Replay verification

\* Hash validation



\---



\# Conformance



The Conformance Suite provides executable evidence that an implementation satisfies the Parmana specification.



Conformance testing is documented separately in `CONFORMANCE.md`.



\---



\# Evidence Promotion Policy



Evidence progresses through the following maturity levels.



| Level       | Meaning                                    |

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |

| Planned     | Design exists, implementation not complete |

| Implemented | Source code exists                         |

| Tested      | Automated tests exist                      |

| Audited     | Manual architectural review completed      |

| Verified    | Independent verification available         |

| Proven      | All required evidence complete             |



Guarantees SHOULD advance through these levels in order.



\---



\# Relationship to Other Documents



\* `SPECIFICATION.md` defines expected behavior.

\* `GUARANTEES.md` defines the guarantees.

\* `PROOFS.md` records the evidence supporting those guarantees.

\* `CLAIMS.md` defines which guarantees are promoted to public technical claims.



\---



\# Engineering Principle



Parmana distinguishes between implementation and proof.



Implementation demonstrates that a capability exists.



Proof demonstrates that the capability is supported by evidence.



Only evidence-backed guarantees should become public technical claims.
