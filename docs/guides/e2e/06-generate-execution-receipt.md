# 06 – Generate an Execution Receipt

This guide demonstrates how to generate an Execution Receipt for a completed Business Transaction.

An Execution Receipt is a cryptographically signed artifact that provides verifiable evidence of a completed and verified execution.

---

## Prerequisites

Complete the following guides before proceeding:

- 01 – Starting the API
- 02 – Authentication
- 03 – Execute a Business Transaction
- 04 – Execute Transaction

Ensure you have a completed Business Transaction.

Example:

```
Business Transaction ID

b9404bdf-ad2a-4dce-8001-0eacd0974200
```

---

## Request File

```
docs/guides/e2e/receipt-request.json
```

```json
{
  "businessTransactionId": "b9404bdf-ad2a-4dce-8001-0eacd0974200"
}
```

---

## Generate Receipt

```powershell
$body = Get-Content .\docs\guides\e2e\receipt-request.json -Raw

Invoke-RestMethod `
    -Method POST `
    -Uri http://localhost:3000/receipt `
    -Headers @{
        Authorization = "Bearer my-secret-api-key"
    } `
    -ContentType "application/json" `
    -Body $body
```

## Successful Response

The API returned the following receipt.

```json
{
  "receiptId": "6f1e7586-ae5d-4718-8d06-36aa541bdb8b",
  "businessTransactionId": "b9404bdf-ad2a-4dce-8001-0eacd0974200",
  "trustRecordHash": "f6b35361c5cf90fefef039c56cacafdb9cc030f0d2c1259e6eb3b565c58cc3e4",

## What This Validates

Generating an Execution Receipt confirms that Parmana successfully:

- Located the completed Business Transaction.
- Retrieved the associated Execution Trust Record.
- Generated a deterministic Receipt Hash.
- Signed the receipt using the configured signature provider.
- Returned a portable cryptographic artifact that can be independently verified.

The receipt serves as verifiable evidence that the execution completed successfully and is suitable for audit, compliance, and long-term record keeping.
