\# Deployment Components



| Component | Purpose |

|-----------|---------|

| API | Exposes REST endpoints |

| Runtime | Executes Business Transactions |

| Governance | Evaluates execution policies |

| Crypto | Hashes, signs, and verifies Trust Records |

| Repository | Stores immutable Trust Records |

| Database | Persists execution evidence |

| Connectors | Integrate with external business systems |



\---



\# Environment Configuration



Typical configuration includes:



\- API host and port

\- Database connection

\- Cryptographic key location

\- Authentication configuration

\- Logging level



Store sensitive values using environment variables or a secure secrets manager.



\---



\# Development Deployment



Development deployments typically use:



\- File-based keys

\- Local database

\- Local API server

\- Sample connectors



This configuration is intended for development and testing only.



\---



\# Production Deployment



Production deployments should use:



\- HTTPS termination

\- Managed database

\- Secure key management (HSM or KMS)

\- Centralized logging

\- Monitoring and alerting

\- Automated backups

\- High availability



\---



\# High Availability



For resilient deployments:



\- Run multiple API instances.

\- Use a load balancer.

\- Replicate the database.

\- Monitor service health.

\- Automate failover where appropriate.



\---



\# Logging and Monitoring



Monitor:



\- API availability

\- Authentication failures

\- Execution throughput

\- Verification failures

\- Receipt generation

\- Replay requests

\- Database health



Logs should include correlation identifiers such as the Business Transaction ID.



\---



\# Backup and Recovery



Regularly back up:



\- Trust Record repository

\- Audit database

\- Configuration

\- Public keys



Protect private signing keys using secure key management and recovery procedures.



\---



\# Security Checklist



Before production:



\- Enable HTTPS.

\- Protect private keys with HSM or KMS.

\- Rotate signing keys.

\- Restrict API access.

\- Secure environment variables.

\- Enable monitoring and alerting.

\- Verify backup procedures.
