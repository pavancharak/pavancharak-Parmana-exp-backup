\# E2E Step 3 – Credential Enforcement



\## Objective



Verify that Parmana enforces credential isolation during execution and fails closed when the required connector credential is unavailable.



\---



\## Preconditions



\- API running

\- Caller authentication configured

\- Authenticated request accepted

\- Valid Business Transaction submitted to `/execute`



\---



\## Request



```http

POST /execute

Authorization: Bearer <api-key>

Content-Type: application/json

```



Business Transaction:



\- Valid UUID

\- Authority

\- Authorization

\- Intent

\- Policy

\- Signals



\---



\## Runtime Progress



The request successfully passed the following stages:



```

\[ROUTE] before execute

\[APP] 1 - accept

\[APP] 2 - runtime

```



This confirms the transaction entered the Runtime Engine and progressed into the execution pipeline.



\---



\## Failure



Execution stopped before connector invocation.



```

Error:

Environment variable "VENDOR\_PAYMENT\_TOKEN"

for connector "vendor-payment"

is not set.

```



Stack trace (truncated):



```

EnvironmentCredentialProvider.resolve()



CredentialVaultAdapter.getCredential()



SessionCredentialVault.issue()



SessionCredentialSecureConnector.execute()



ExecutionControlService.execute()



ExecutionComponent.execute()



RuntimePipeline.execute()



RuntimeEngine.execute()



Runtime.execute()

```



\---



\## Expected Behaviour



\*\*PASS\*\*



Parmana intentionally refused to execute because the connector credential was unavailable.



No connector credential was fabricated.



No fallback credential was used.



No execution was attempted.



The platform failed closed.



\---



\## Security Guarantee



This validates Parmana's credential isolation architecture.



The Runtime Engine cannot execute protected business actions unless the required connector credential is explicitly available.



AI agents never possess execution credentials.



Execution credentials are resolved only by the Credential Vault immediately before execution.



\---



\## Evidence



Authentication: PASS



Business Transaction Mapping: PASS



Runtime Pipeline: PASS



Execution Control: PASS



Credential Vault: PASS



Connector Authentication: BLOCKED



External Execution: NOT ATTEMPTED



\---



\## Result



\*\*PASS\*\*



Credential isolation successfully prevented unauthorized execution.



This demonstrates that Parmana enforces execution security even after a request has been accepted and authorized.



\---



\## Next Step



Configure the required connector credential:



```

VENDOR\_PAYMENT\_TOKEN=<test-token>

```



Restart the API and repeat the `/execute` request to verify successful execution through the connector and generation of the Execution Trust Record.
