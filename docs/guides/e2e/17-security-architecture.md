\# 17 – Security Architecture



This guide describes the security architecture of the Parmana Execution Trust Platform and the mechanisms used to protect execution, evidence, and verification.



\---



\# Security Objectives



Parmana is designed to ensure that:



\- Only authenticated callers can request execution.

\- Execution decisions are deterministic.

\- Approved executions are cryptographically bound to their authorization.

\- Execution evidence cannot be modified without detection.

\- Verification is independent and reproducible.

\- Audit evidence remains immutable.

\---



\# Authentication



Protected API endpoints require a valid Bearer API key.



Public endpoints include:



\- GET /health

\- GET /openapi.yaml

\- GET /documentation



Unauthorized requests receive:



```json

{

&#x20; "error": "authentication required"

}

```



\---



\# Deterministic Policy Evaluation



Execution decisions are deterministic.



Given the same inputs and policy version, the Runtime always produces the same decision.



\---



\# Authorization Binding



Every approved execution must reference an authorization identifier.



During verification, Parmana validates that each approved execution includes this binding.



Missing authorization bindings cause verification to fail.



\---



\# Integrity Protection



Parmana computes a SHA-256 hash over the canonical Execution Trust Record.



Any modification to protected data changes the hash and is detected during verification.



\---



\# Digital Signatures



The canonical Trust Record is signed using an Ed25519 private key.



Verification uses the corresponding public key to confirm authenticity.



\---



\# Immutable Audit Evidence



The following data is immutable:



\- Business Transaction

\- Executions

\- Decisions

\- Overrides

\- Created At



Verification history and receipts are append-only lifecycle artifacts and are intentionally excluded from the canonical representation.



\---



\# Replay Verification



Replay reconstructs the canonical Trust Record and performs the same integrity and signature checks without re-executing the business action.



\---



\# Security Properties



Parmana provides:



\- Authenticated execution requests

\- Deterministic policy decisions

\- Authorization binding

\- Tamper detection

\- Digital authenticity

\- Immutable execution evidence

\- Independent verification

\- Deterministic replay

\# Threat Mitigations



| Threat | Mitigation |

|---------|------------|

| Unauthorized API access | Bearer authentication |

| Tampering with execution evidence | SHA-256 integrity verification |

| Forged Trust Records | Ed25519 digital signatures |

| Missing execution authorization | Authorization binding verification |

| Undetected data modification | Independent verification service |

| Loss of auditability | Immutable Execution Trust Records |



\---



\# Summary



Parmana combines authenticated access, deterministic execution, cryptographic integrity, digital signatures, authorization binding, and immutable audit evidence to ensure that every business execution can be independently verified and trusted.
