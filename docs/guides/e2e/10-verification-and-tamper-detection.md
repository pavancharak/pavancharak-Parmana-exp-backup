\# 10 – Verification and Tamper Detection



Parmana verifies an Execution Trust Record using three independent checks.



\## Verification Pipeline



```

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Integrity Check

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Signature Check

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Authorization Binding Check

&#x20;       │

Verification Result

```

\## Canonical Trust Record



Parmana hashes and signs only the immutable portion of the Execution Trust Record.



Included in the canonical representation:



\- Trust Record ID

\- Business Transaction ID

\- Business Transaction

\- Overrides

\- Executions

\- Created At



Excluded from the canonical representation:



\- Verification history

\- Receipt history

\- Trust Record hash

\- Signature

\- Updated At



This design allows additional verification events and execution receipts to be appended over time without changing the cryptographically protected content of the Execution Trust Record. As a result, the original evidence remains stable while the audit history can continue to grow.



\## 1. Integrity Check



The Trust Record hash is recomputed from the stored record.



Verification fails if the recomputed hash differs from the stored `trustRecordHash`.



\## 2. Signature Check



The Ed25519 signature is verified using the configured public key.



Verification fails if the signature cannot be validated.



\## 3. Authorization Binding



Every execution whose decision is `APPROVED` must contain a valid `authorizationId`.



Rejected executions are not required to contain an authorization binding.



\## Failure Reporting



All verification checks execute independently.



Verification reports every failed check instead of stopping after the first failure.



This produces a complete verification result suitable for forensic investigation.
