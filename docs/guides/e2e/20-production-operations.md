\# 20 – Production Operations



This guide describes the operational practices for running the Parmana Execution Trust Platform in production.



\---



\# Overview



Production operations focus on maintaining the availability, integrity, security, and auditability of the platform.



Operational responsibilities include:



\- Monitoring

\- Logging

\- Incident response

\- Backup and recovery

\- Key rotation

\- Software upgrades

\- Capacity planning

\# Health Monitoring



Monitor the health of:



\- API availability

\- Runtime services

\- Database connectivity

\- Trust Record repository

\- Connector availability

\- Cryptographic services



Health checks should be integrated with enterprise monitoring platforms.



\---



\# Metrics



Recommended metrics include:



| Metric | Description |

|---------|-------------|

| API Requests | Total REST API requests |

| Authentication Failures | Unauthorized access attempts |

| Executions | Successful Business Transactions |

| Verification Success Rate | Percentage of successful verifications |

| Verification Failures | Failed integrity or signature checks |

| Receipt Generation | Generated execution receipts |

| Replay Requests | Replay verification operations |

| Database Latency | Repository response time |



\---



\# Logging



Application logs should include:



\- Business Transaction ID

\- Trust Record ID

\- Verification ID

\- Receipt ID

\- Request correlation ID

\- Timestamp

\- Service name

\- Log level



Avoid logging sensitive business data or private cryptographic material.



\---



\# Alerting



Configure alerts for:



\- API downtime

\- Repeated authentication failures

\- Verification failures

\- Database connectivity issues

\- Connector failures

\- High error rates

\- Resource exhaustion



\---



\# Incident Response



When an incident occurs:



1\. Identify the affected component.

2\. Review application logs.

3\. Verify system health.

4\. Inspect related Business Transaction IDs.

5\. Validate affected Execution Trust Records.

6\. Determine root cause.

7\. Restore service.

8\. Document the incident.



\---



\# Backup Strategy



Regularly back up:



\- Trust Record repository

\- Audit database

\- Configuration

\- Public keys

\- Operational documentation



Private signing keys should follow the organization's secure backup and recovery procedures.



\---



\# Key Rotation



When rotating signing keys:



1\. Generate a new key pair.

2\. Assign a new key identifier.

3\. Update signing configuration.

4\. Retain previous public keys.

5\. Verify new signatures.

6\. Monitor verification results.



Historical Trust Records remain verifiable because they reference the key used when they were signed.



\---



\# Software Upgrades



Before upgrading:



\- Review release notes.

\- Back up critical data.

\- Test in a staging environment.

\- Validate API compatibility.

\- Verify cryptographic functionality.

\- Confirm successful deployment with health checks.



\---



\# Capacity Planning



Monitor:



\- Request throughput

\- Concurrent executions

\- Database growth

\- Storage consumption

\- CPU utilization

\- Memory utilization

\- Connector response times



Scale infrastructure proactively based on observed trends.



\---



\# Operational Checklist



Daily:



\- Review health dashboards.

\- Check alert status.

\- Verify backup completion.

\- Review authentication failures.



Weekly:



\- Review execution metrics.

\- Analyze verification failures.

\- Validate replay functionality.

\- Inspect storage growth.



Monthly:



\- Review security configuration.

\- Audit operational procedures.

\- Test backup restoration.

\- Review capacity forecasts.

\# Summary



Operating Parmana in production requires continuous monitoring, structured incident response, secure key management, reliable backup procedures, and regular operational reviews. These practices help ensure that execution governance remains available, trustworthy, and auditable throughout the platform's lifecycle.
