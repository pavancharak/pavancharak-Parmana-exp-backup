\# 05 – Verify an Execution Trust Record



This guide demonstrates how to independently verify an Execution Trust Record after execution.



Verification confirms that the Trust Record has not been modified since it was created and that its cryptographic signature is valid.



\---



\## Prerequisites



Complete:



\- 01 – Starting the API

\- 02 – Authentication

\- 03 – Execute a Business Transaction



You should have a Trust Record ID similar to:



```

3280db24-fdd3-4feb-ac04-97c3b07c8c41

```



\---



\## Verify



Send the Trust Record to the verification endpoint.



```powershell

$body = Get-Content .\\docs\\guides\\e2e\\verify-request.json -Raw



Invoke-RestMethod `

&#x20;   -Method POST `

&#x20;   -Uri http://localhost:3000/verify `

&#x20;   -Headers @{

&#x20;       Authorization = "Bearer my-secret-api-key"

&#x20;   } `

&#x20;   -ContentType "application/json" `

&#x20;   -Body $body

```



\---



\## Successful Response



A successful verification returns:



```json

{

&#x20; "status": "VERIFIED",

&#x20; "message": "Execution Trust Record verified successfully.",

&#x20; "verificationId": "999bedec-876d-4fdf-b1a3-91d01866ffcd",

&#x20; "verifiedAt": "2026-07-18T03:59:45.798Z",

&#x20; "trustRecordHash": "f6b35361c5cf90fefef039c56cacafdb9cc030f0d2c1259e6eb3b565c58cc3e4",

&#x20; "businessTransactionId": "b9404bdf-ad2a-4dce-8001-0eacd0974200"

}

```

\## What Verification Confirms



Verification provides independent evidence that:



\- The Trust Record has not been altered.

\- The cryptographic signature is valid.

\- The recorded execution is authentic.

\- The evidence is suitable for audit and compliance.



Verification does not re-execute the business transaction. It validates the integrity and authenticity of the recorded execution.



\---



\## Expected Failure Cases



Verification should fail if:



\- Any field in the Trust Record is modified.

\- The Trust Record hash changes.

\- The signature is altered.

\- The signing key is unknown.

\- The signature algorithm does not match the stored signature.



These failure modes help detect tampering and protect the integrity of execution evidence.
