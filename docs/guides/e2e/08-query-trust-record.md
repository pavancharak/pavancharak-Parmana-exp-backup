\# 08 – Query an Execution Trust Record



This guide demonstrates how to retrieve the complete Execution Trust Record for a previously executed Business Transaction.



The current implementation retrieves Trust Records using the \*\*Business Transaction ID\*\*.



\---



\## Prerequisites



Complete:



\- 01 – Starting the API

\- 02 – Authentication

\- 03 – Execute a Business Transaction

\- 04 – Execute Transaction

\- 05 – Verify an Execution Trust Record

\- 06 – Generate an Execution Receipt

\- 07 – Replay a Business Transaction



\---



\## Business Transaction ID



Example



```

b9404bdf-ad2a-4dce-8001-0eacd0974200

```



\---



\## Retrieve the Trust Record



```powershell

Invoke-RestMethod `

&#x20;   -Method GET `

&#x20;   -Uri "http://localhost:3000/trust-records/b9404bdf-ad2a-4dce-8001-0eacd0974200" `

&#x20;   -Headers @{

&#x20;       Authorization = "Bearer my-secret-api-key"

&#x20;   } |

&#x20;   ConvertTo-Json -Depth 100

```



\---



\## Successful Response



The API returned the complete Execution Trust Record.



The response includes:



\- Trust Record metadata

\- Business Transaction

\- Intent

\- Authority

\- Authorization

\- Policy

\- Signals

\- Execution Decision

\- Connector Evidence

\- Verifications

\- Receipts

\- Cryptographic Signature



Save the response as:



```

docs/guides/e2e/trust-record-response.json

```

\## Execution Trust Record Structure



```

│   ├── Intent

│   ├── Authority

│   ├── Authorization

│   ├── Policy

│   └── Signals

│

├── Executions

│   ├── Policy Decision

│   └── Connector Evidence

├── Verifications

└── Cryptographic Signature

```

\## What This Demonstrates



Retrieving the Trust Record confirms that Parmana permanently stores the complete execution history of a Business Transaction.



The record provides a complete audit trail including:



\- Original request

\- Policy evaluation

\- Authorization

\- Execution evidence

\- Verification history

\- Receipt history

\- Cryptographic proof



This allows an auditor to reconstruct and verify the execution without re-running the business operation.



\---



\## Implementation Note



Although the route is defined as:



```

GET /trust-records/:id

```



the current implementation expects the \*\*Business Transaction ID\*\* rather than the Trust Record ID.
