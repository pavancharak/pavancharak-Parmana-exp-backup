\# 18 – Key Management



This guide describes how Parmana manages cryptographic keys used to sign and verify Execution Trust Records.



\---



\# Overview



Parmana uses asymmetric cryptography to provide authenticity for Execution Trust Records.



The Runtime signs Trust Records using a private key, while verification uses the corresponding public key.



```

Private Key

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Sign Trust Record

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Public Key

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verify Signature

```



\---



\# Key Components



The cryptographic implementation consists of:



| Component | Responsibility |

|-----------|----------------|

| FileKeyProvider | Loads cryptographic keys |

| DEFAULT\_KEY\_ID | Default signing key identifier |

| ArtifactSigner | Creates digital signatures |

| SignatureVerifier | Verifies signatures |

| VerificationCrypto | Coordinates hashing, signing, and verification |



\---



\# Signing Process



During execution:



1\. Create the canonical Trust Record.

2\. Compute the Trust Record hash.

3\. Load the private key.

4\. Sign the canonical Trust Record.

5\. Store the signature with the Trust Record.



```

Canonical Record

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Private Key

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Ed25519 Signature

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Trust Record

```



\---



\# Verification Process



During verification:



1\. Load the public key referenced by the Trust Record.

2\. Reconstruct the canonical Trust Record.

3\. Verify the digital signature.

4\. Report the verification result.



```

\# Key Identification



Every signature includes:



\- Algorithm

\- Key ID

\- Signature Value

\- Signed Timestamp



The `keyId` identifies which public key should be used during verification.



\---



\# Development Keys



The development environment uses file-based keys loaded by the `FileKeyProvider`.



These keys are intended for:



\- Local development

\- Testing

\- Continuous Integration



They should not be used in production.



\---



\# Production Recommendations



Production deployments should replace the file-based key provider with a secure key management solution such as:



\- Hardware Security Module (HSM)

\- Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)

\- Enterprise secrets management platform



The Runtime should never expose private keys outside the signing process.



\---



\# Key Rotation



Key rotation should follow these principles:



\- Generate a new signing key pair.

\- Assign a new `keyId`.

\- Use the new private key for future signatures.

\- Retain previous public keys to verify historical Trust Records.



Historical signatures remain valid because each Trust Record references the `keyId` that was used when it was signed.



\---



\# Security Considerations



To protect signing keys:



\- Restrict filesystem access.

\- Limit key usage to the signing service.

\- Monitor key access.

\- Rotate keys periodically.

\- Back up keys securely.

\- Protect production keys with HSM or KMS.

\# Trust Model



```text

Private Key

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Sign

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Public Key

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verify

```



The Runtime requires the private key only for signing. Verification requires only the corresponding public key.



\---



\# Summary



Parmana separates signing and verification through asymmetric cryptography. Trust Records are signed with a private key and verified with the matching public key, enabling independent verification while supporting secure key rotation and long-term validation of historical execution evidence.
