\# 25 – Contributing



This guide explains how to contribute to the Parmana Execution Trust Platform while maintaining its architectural principles and code quality.



\---



\# Purpose



Parmana is designed around deterministic execution, immutable evidence, and independent verification.



Every contribution should preserve these principles.



\---



\# Development Principles



Contributors should follow these core principles:



\- Deterministic behavior

\- Immutable execution evidence

\- Clear separation of concerns

\- Security by default

\- Comprehensive testing

\- Well-documented changes



\---

\# Branching



Use descriptive branch names.



Examples:



\- feature/execution-gateway

\- feature/key-rotation

\- fix/verification-service

\- docs/api-reference



\---



\# Coding Standards



Contributors should:



\- Use TypeScript strict mode.

\- Prefer small, focused classes.

\- Keep functions concise.

\- Avoid duplicated logic.

\- Write meaningful comments where intent is not obvious.



\---



\# Testing



Every change should include appropriate tests.



Recommended categories:



\- Unit tests

\- Integration tests

\- API tests

\- Cryptographic verification tests

\- Replay tests



All existing tests should pass before submitting a pull request.



\---



\# Documentation



Documentation should be updated whenever:



\- APIs change

\- Runtime behavior changes

\- Security behavior changes

\- New configuration is introduced

\- New guides are added



\---



\# Security



Do not:



\- Commit private keys

\- Commit secrets

\- Hard-code credentials

\- Log sensitive information



Report security issues through the project's responsible disclosure process rather than public issue trackers.



\---



\# Pull Requests



A pull request should include:



\- Summary of changes

\- Motivation

\- Testing performed

\- Documentation updates

\- Any compatibility considerations



\---



\# Code Review Checklist



Reviewers should verify:



\- Correctness

\- Deterministic behavior

\- Backward compatibility

\- Test coverage

\- Documentation updates

\- Security implications



\---



\# Architectural Principles



Changes should preserve:



\- Deterministic execution

\- Immutable Trust Records

\- Canonical hashing

\- Independent verification

\- Append-only lifecycle artifacts

\- Clear package boundaries



\---



\# Summary



Successful contributions improve the platform while preserving Parmana's core architectural guarantees: deterministic execution, cryptographic integrity, immutable evidence, and independent verification.
