\# 14 – Domain Model



This guide describes the core domain objects used by the Parmana Execution Trust Platform and how they relate to one another.

\# Business Transaction



A Business Transaction represents a business operation requested by a caller.



Examples include:



\- Vendor creation

\- Invoice approval

\- Payment

\- Purchase Order

\- Contract approval



Each transaction receives a unique Business Transaction ID.



\---



\# Execution



An Execution represents an attempt to perform a business action.



Each execution records:



\- Execution ID

\- Decision

\- Metadata

\- Connector information

\- Evidence



Multiple executions may belong to a single Business Transaction.



\---



\# Decision



A Decision represents the policy evaluation result.



Possible outcomes include:



\- APPROVED

\- REJECTED



Each execution contains exactly one decision.



\---



\# Authorization



Approved executions must contain an authorization identifier.



The authorization binding proves that the execution was authorized before it occurred.



\---



\# Execution Trust Record



The Execution Trust Record is the immutable evidence package produced after execution.



It contains:



\- Transaction

\- Executions

\- Overrides

\- Hash

\- Signature

\- Verification history

\- Receipt history



The Trust Record is the primary audit artifact.



\---



\# Verification



Verification validates the Trust Record by checking:



\- Integrity

\- Signature

\- Authorization Binding



Verification results are appended without modifying the protected evidence.



\---



\# Receipt



A Receipt is cryptographic proof that an Execution Trust Record existed in a verified state.



Receipts are append-only lifecycle artifacts.



\---

\# Immutable vs Mutable Data



Immutable:



\- Business Transaction

\- Executions

\- Decisions

\- Overrides

\- Created At



Mutable Lifecycle Artifacts:



\- Verification History

\- Receipt History



Only immutable fields are included in the canonical representation used for hashing and signing.



\---



\# Summary



Parmana models execution as a sequence of immutable business evidence protected by cryptographic integrity and enriched over time with verification and receipt lifecycle events.
