\# Execution Lifecycle



Every Business Transaction follows the same deterministic lifecycle.



1\. Authenticate the caller.

2\. Accept the Business Transaction.

3\. Evaluate the execution policy.

4\. Execute the approved action.

5\. Collect execution evidence.

6\. Build the Execution Trust Record.

7\. Verify the Trust Record.

8\. Generate a cryptographic Receipt.

9\. Store immutable execution evidence.

10\. Support deterministic replay.

\# Core Components



| Component | Responsibility |

|-----------|----------------|

| Authentication Middleware | Authenticates API callers before execution. |

| Business Transaction Service | Stores and validates Business Transactions. |

| Runtime | Executes policy evaluation and connector invocation. |

| Verification Service | Verifies integrity, signature, and authorization binding. |

| Receipt Service | Generates cryptographic execution receipts. |

| Trust Record Repository | Stores immutable Execution Trust Records. |

| Verification Crypto | Provides hashing, signing, and signature verification. |

\# Verification Pipeline



Verification performs three independent checks.



```text

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ├── Integrity Check

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ├── Signature Verification

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       └── Authorization Binding

&#x20;               │

&#x20;               ▼

&#x20;         Verification Result

```



All verification checks execute independently. Every detected failure is reported.



\---



\# Replay Pipeline



Replay does not execute the Business Transaction again.



Instead it:



1\. Loads the stored Execution Trust Record.

2\. Reconstructs the canonical representation.

3\. Recomputes the Trust Record Hash.

4\. Verifies the digital signature.

5\. Returns the verification result.



\---



\# Trust Model



Parmana establishes trust through:



\- Authenticated callers

\- Deterministic execution

\- Immutable execution evidence

\- Cryptographic hashing

\- Digital signatures

\- Independent verification

\- Replayable audit evidence

\# Summary



Parmana transforms Business Transactions into immutable, cryptographically verifiable Execution Trust Records.



Every execution can be independently verified, replayed, and audited without relying on the original execution environment, providing deterministic execution evidence suitable for enterprise governance, compliance, and forensic investigation.
