\# 04 – Execute a Business Transaction



This guide walks through the complete execution lifecycle in Parmana—from submitting a business transaction through execution, verification, and receipt generation.



\---



\## Prerequisites



The API is running:



```text

API running on http://localhost:3000

```



Authentication is configured:



```env

PARMANA\_API\_KEYS=\[{"callerId":"demo","keyHash":"325ededd6c3b9988f623c7f964abb9b016b76b0f8b3474df0f7d7c23b941381f"}]

```



Execution connector credential is configured:



```env

VENDOR\_PAYMENT\_TOKEN=integration-test-token

```



\---



\## Execute



```powershell

$body = Get-Content .\\docs\\guides\\e2e\\execute-request.json -Raw



Invoke-RestMethod `

&#x20;   -Method POST `

&#x20;   -Uri http://localhost:3000/execute `

&#x20;   -Headers @{

&#x20;       Authorization = "Bearer my-secret-api-key"

&#x20;   } `

&#x20;   -ContentType "application/json" `

&#x20;   -Body $body

```



\---



\## Successful Response



The API returned a complete Execution Trust Record.

\## Digital Signature



Algorithm



```

```



The Execution Trust Record was signed successfully.



\---



\## Independent Verification



Verification Status



```

VERIFIED

```



Message



```

Execution Trust Record verified successfully.

```



This confirms that the generated Trust Record is cryptographically valid and has not been modified.



\---



\## Execution Receipt



A signed Execution Receipt was issued.

\## What This Demonstrates



This walkthrough validates the complete Parmana execution pipeline:



\- Caller authentication

\- Business transaction creation

\- Policy evaluation

\- Authorized execution

\- Connector invocation

\- Execution Trust Record generation

\- Cryptographic signing

\- Independent verification

\- Execution Receipt issuance



The returned Execution Trust Record provides verifiable evidence of what was requested, what policy authorized it, what was executed, and the cryptographic proof needed to independently validate the outcome.
