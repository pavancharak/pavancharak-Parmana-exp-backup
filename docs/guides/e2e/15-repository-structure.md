\# 15 – Repository Structure



This guide describes the organization of the Parmana monorepo and the responsibility of each package.

\# packages/



The `packages` directory contains the implementation of the Parmana platform.



| Package | Responsibility |

|----------|----------------|

| api | REST API and HTTP endpoints |

| runtime | Business execution and orchestration |

| crypto | Hashing, signing, verification, key management |

| governance | Policy evaluation and execution authorization |

| execution | Execution pipeline and execution models |

| verifier | Trust Record verification |

| sdk-client | TypeScript SDK |

| audit-db | Audit persistence |

| core | Shared runtime services |

\# docs/



Documentation for developers, operators, and users.



```text

└── security/

```



\---



\# examples/



Reference implementations demonstrating common workflows.



Examples include:



\- Hello World

\- Execute Transaction

\- Verify

\- Receipt

\- Replay



These examples are intended for learning and testing.



\---



\# scripts/



Repository automation.



Typical scripts include:



\- Build

\- Test

\- OpenAPI generation

\- Documentation generation

\- Verification utilities

\- CI validation



\---



\# keys/



Development cryptographic keys used for local testing.



Production deployments should replace these with secure key management solutions.



\---



\# .github/



GitHub Actions workflows for:



\- Build

\- Test

\- Lint

\- Documentation validation

\- Release automation



\---

\# Dependency Principles



The repository follows these principles:



\- Single responsibility per package

\- Shared models through common libraries

\- Deterministic runtime behavior

\- Clear separation between API, runtime, cryptography, and persistence

\- Reusable packages for SDKs and tooling



\---



\# Summary



The Parmana monorepo separates HTTP APIs, runtime execution, cryptographic services, governance logic, verification, and persistence into focused packages, making the platform easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
