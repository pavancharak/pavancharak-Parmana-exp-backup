\# 24 – Design Decisions



This document records the key architectural decisions behind the Parmana Execution Trust Platform, the reasoning for each decision, and the associated trade-offs.



\---



\# Purpose



Architectural decisions are difficult to change after a platform is adopted.



This document explains why Parmana was designed the way it is and serves as a reference for future contributors and maintainers.



\---



\# Decision 1 – Deterministic Execution



\## Decision



Execution decisions must be deterministic.



The same Business Transaction, policy version, and execution inputs must always produce the same decision.



\## Rationale



Deterministic behavior enables:



\- Independent verification

\- Reliable replay

\- Predictable auditing

\- Consistent compliance



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Reproducible decisions

\- Easier testing

\- Easier auditing



Cons



\- Reduced flexibility for non-deterministic workflows

\- Greater emphasis on controlled inputs



\---



\# Decision 2 – Immutable Execution Evidence



\## Decision



Execution evidence is immutable after it is created.



\## Rationale



Audit evidence must remain stable throughout its lifetime.



Verification relies on immutable execution data.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Strong audit guarantees

\- Reliable replay

\- Simplified verification



Cons



\- Corrections require new records rather than modifying existing ones



\---



\# Decision 3 – Canonical Representation



\## Decision



Only immutable fields are included in the canonical representation used for hashing and signing.



Included:



\- Trust Record ID

\- Business Transaction ID

\- Transaction

\- Overrides

\- Executions

\- Created At



Excluded:



\- Verification history

\- Receipt history

\- Signature

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Updated At



\## Rationale



Lifecycle artifacts grow over time and should not invalidate existing signatures.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Stable signatures

\- Append-only audit history



Cons



\- Developers must clearly distinguish immutable evidence from lifecycle metadata



\---



\# Decision 4 – Asymmetric Cryptography



\## Decision



Use asymmetric cryptography for signing and verification.



\## Rationale



Only the Runtime requires the private signing key.



Verification requires only the corresponding public key.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Independent verification

\- Secure key separation

\- Supports key rotation



Cons



\- Additional operational requirements for key management



\---



\# Decision 5 – Independent Verification



\## Decision



Verification is performed independently of execution.



\## Rationale



Verification should validate stored evidence rather than trust execution results.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Detects tampering

\- Supports forensic analysis

\- Enables replay



Cons



\- Additional verification processing



\---



\# Decision 6 – Authorization Binding



\## Decision



Every approved execution must include an `authorizationId`.



\## Rationale



Execution must be traceable to the authorization that permitted it.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Strong accountability

\- Improved auditability



Cons



\- Additional metadata requirements



\---



\# Decision 7 – Append-Only Lifecycle Artifacts



\## Decision



Verification events and receipts are append-only.



\## Rationale



Execution evidence remains immutable while operational history continues to grow.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Preserves cryptographic integrity

\- Complete audit history



Cons



\- Larger storage requirements over time



\---



\# Decision 8 – Layered Architecture



\## Decision



Separate responsibilities into focused packages.



Examples include:



\- API

\- Runtime

\- Crypto

\- Governance

\- Repository



\## Rationale



Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability and testing.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Modular design

\- Easier evolution

\- Improved code ownership



Cons



\- More package boundaries to manage



\---



\# Decision 9 – API-First Design



\## Decision



Expose platform capabilities through a REST API with an OpenAPI specification.



\## Rationale



An API-first approach simplifies integration, client generation, and testing.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Consistent integrations

\- Interactive documentation

\- Standard tooling support



Cons



\- API versioning must be managed carefully



\---



\# Decision 10 – Replay Without Re-Execution



\## Decision



Replay verifies stored execution evidence instead of executing the original business action again.



\## Rationale



Replay should validate evidence without producing additional business side effects.



\## Trade-offs



Pros



\- Safe verification

\- Deterministic results

\- No duplicate business operations



Cons



\- Replay cannot validate changes in external systems after the original execution



\---



\# Summary



The Parmana architecture emphasizes deterministic execution, immutable evidence, independent verification, and modular design. These decisions collectively support trustworthy execution authorization while balancing operational simplicity, security, and long-term maintainability.
