\# Problem



\## Purpose



This document defines the fundamental problem that Parmana is designed to solve.



It explains why current AI systems cannot be safely trusted to execute high-impact business operations, identifies the limitations of existing approaches, and establishes the requirements for an execution authorization and verification infrastructure.



This document describes the problem. It does not describe the implementation of Parmana, which is covered in later architecture documents.

\# Problem Statement



Artificial Intelligence has reached a level of capability where it can understand instructions, reason about complex tasks, generate software, analyze documents, and interact with enterprise applications.



While these capabilities continue to improve, organizations face a different challenge:



\*\*How can AI be trusted to execute real business operations?\*\*



The ability to perform work is not sufficient. Organizations must also ensure that every action is authorized, policy-compliant, verifiable, and accountable.



Without these guarantees, autonomous AI cannot be safely deployed in high-impact enterprise environments.



\---



\# The Capability Gap Has Changed



Historically, enterprise AI was limited by capability.



Organizations asked:



\* Can AI understand documents?

\* Can AI answer customer questions?

\* Can AI summarize reports?

\* Can AI generate software?

\* Can AI automate repetitive work?



Modern AI systems increasingly answer "yes" to these questions.



The challenge has shifted from \*\*capability\*\* to \*\*trust\*\*.



Organizations are no longer asking whether AI can perform a task.



They are asking whether AI should be allowed to perform that task.

\# Enterprise Execution Is Different



Enterprise operations are governed by policies, regulations, contractual obligations, internal controls, and risk management practices.



Many actions have significant consequences, including:



\* Financial loss

\* Regulatory violations

\* Security incidents

\* Privacy breaches

\* Operational disruption

\* Legal liability

\* Reputational damage



Examples of high-impact actions include:



\* Approving financial transactions

\* Granting privileged system access

\* Updating customer records

\* Executing procurement requests

\* Modifying payroll information

\* Releasing confidential information

\* Initiating infrastructure changes



These actions require organizational authorization before execution.



\---



\# Intelligence Does Not Establish Authority



An AI system may determine that an action appears appropriate.



However, a correct recommendation is not the same as authorization.



Execution authority belongs to the organization.



Organizations determine:



\* Who may perform an action

\* Under what conditions

\* Which approvals are required

\* Which policies apply

\* Which evidence must be verified



AI capability cannot replace organizational authority.



\---



\# Existing AI Systems Lack Execution Governance



Most AI systems focus on reasoning, planning, or content generation.



They typically assume that if an action appears reasonable, it may proceed.



This assumption is insufficient for enterprise environments.



Existing approaches often lack:



\* Independent policy evaluation

\* Verification of enterprise facts

\* Explicit human approval requirements

\* Deterministic authorization decisions

\* Cryptographically verifiable execution evidence

\* Independent auditability

\* Replayable authorization decisions



As a result, organizations must either restrict AI capabilities or accept increased operational risk.



\---



\# Enterprise Trust Requires More Than AI Confidence



Model confidence scores indicate how certain an AI system is about its own output.



They do not answer critical governance questions such as:



\* Is this action permitted by organizational policy?

\* Does the requester have authority?

\* Has the required approval been obtained?

\* Is the underlying enterprise data current?

\* Does this action violate compliance requirements?

\* Can the authorization decision be independently verified later?



These questions require trusted evidence that exists outside the AI model itself.



\---



\# The Cost of Missing Authorization



Without reliable execution authorization, organizations face several risks:



\## Operational Risk



AI may execute actions that violate established business procedures.



\## Compliance Risk



Actions may breach regulatory or contractual obligations.



\## Security Risk



Unauthorized access or changes may compromise enterprise systems.



\## Financial Risk



Incorrect approvals or transactions may result in financial loss.



\## Audit Risk



Organizations may be unable to demonstrate why an action occurred or who authorized it.



\## Governance Risk



Decision-making authority may shift from organizational policy to AI behavior.



\---



\# Requirements for Trusted AI Execution



To safely deploy autonomous AI in enterprise environments, organizations require an infrastructure that can answer the following questions before execution:



\* Is the action authorized?

\* Which organizational policy applies?

\* What enterprise facts were verified?

\* Which human approvals were required?

\* What evidence supports the authorization decision?

\* Can the decision be independently reproduced?

\* Can the organization demonstrate compliance during an audit?



Answering these questions consistently requires an execution authorization and verification layer that operates independently of the AI system.



\---



\# Why Existing Infrastructure Is Not Enough



Traditional enterprise systems provide components such as:



\* Identity and access management

\* Workflow engines

\* Approval systems

\* Policy repositories

\* Audit logs



These systems were designed primarily for human users or deterministic software.



Autonomous AI introduces a new execution model in which decisions may be generated dynamically.



Organizations therefore require infrastructure specifically designed to evaluate and authorize AI-initiated execution requests before actions occur.



\---



\# The Need for an Execution Trust Layer



Autonomous AI requires more than intelligent models.



It requires an independent trust layer that:



\* Evaluates execution requests

\* Applies organizational policies

\* Verifies trusted enterprise evidence

\* Confirms required human authority

\* Produces deterministic authorization decisions

\* Generates independently verifiable execution records

\* Supports replay and audit



This trust layer must remain independent of the AI system that proposed the action.



\---



\# Summary



The central challenge facing enterprise AI is not intelligence.



The challenge is trusted execution.



Organizations cannot safely delegate operational authority to AI based solely on model capability or confidence.



They require a system that ensures every high-impact action is authorized, policy-compliant, supported by trusted evidence, and independently verifiable.



Parmana is designed to address this challenge by providing the execution authorization and verification infrastructure required for trusted enterprise AI.
