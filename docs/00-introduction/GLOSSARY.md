\# Glossary



\## Purpose



This glossary provides a quick-reference alphabetical index of the terminology used throughout the Parmana documentation.



Unlike \*\*TERMINOLOGY.md\*\*, which defines the canonical meaning of each concept, this glossary is intended as a convenient reference for readers.



The definitions in this document are summaries. Where additional detail is required, readers should refer to the corresponding specification document.



\---



\# A



\## AI-Derived Signal



Information produced by an AI system that contributes evidence to an authorization decision but does not independently authorize execution.



See: `01-concepts/SIGNAL\_MODEL.md`



\---



\## Authorization



The determination of whether an Execution Request is permitted to execute according to organizational policy and verified evidence.



See: `01-concepts/AUTHORITY\_VERIFICATION.md`



\---



\## Authorization Decision



The outcome of Authority Verification.



Possible outcomes include:



\* Approved

\* Rejected

\* Escalated

\* Awaiting Approval



See: `01-concepts/AUTHORITY\_VERIFICATION.md`



\---



\# B



\## Business Transaction



A unit of business work initiated by a user, system, or AI that requires organizational authorization before execution.



See: `01-concepts/BUSINESS\_TRANSACTION.md`



\---



\# C



\## Cryptographic Integrity



The property that authorization evidence cannot be modified without detection.



Parmana protects execution records using cryptographic hashing and digital signatures.



See: `02-architecture/CRYPTOGRAPHY.md`



\---



\# E



\## Enterprise Fact



Verified information obtained from an authoritative enterprise system of record.



Examples include:



\* Employee role

\* Budget availability

\* Customer status

\* Purchase order information



See: `01-concepts/SIGNAL\_MODEL.md`



\---



\## Evidence



The collection of verified information evaluated during Authority Verification.



Evidence may include Enterprise Facts, Human Approvals, AI-Derived Signals, Organizational Policies, and Execution Context.



See: `01-concepts/AUTHORITY\_VERIFICATION.md`



\---



\## Execution



The performance of an approved Business Transaction after successful authorization.



Execution occurs only after Authority Verification completes successfully.



\---



\## Execution Context



Information describing the environment in which an Execution Request is evaluated.



Examples include identity, request metadata, timestamps, and policy references.



See: `02-architecture/RUNTIME.md`



\---



\## Execution Receipt



A verifiable summary generated after an authorization decision.



Execution Receipts provide operational evidence that an authorization decision occurred.



See: `01-concepts/EXECUTION\_RECEIPT.md`



\---



\## Execution Request



A structured request submitted to Parmana requesting authorization for a Business Transaction.



An Execution Request does not imply approval.



See: `01-concepts/EXECUTION\_REQUEST.md`



\---



\## Execution Trust Record (ETR)



The canonical record of an authorization decision.



It captures the evidence, policy, verification results, authorization outcome, and integrity information necessary for replay, verification, and audit.



See: `01-concepts/EXECUTION\_TRUST\_RECORD.md`



\---



\# H



\## Human Approval



Explicit authorization provided by an authorized individual as required by organizational policy.



Human Approval cannot be inferred.



See: `05-governance/HUMAN\_APPROVAL.md`



\---



\## Human Authority



The organizational authority delegated to people through governance, policy, and business responsibility.



Human Authority remains the ultimate source of execution authority.



See: `01-concepts/HUMAN\_AUTHORITY.md`



\---



\# O



\## Organizational Policy



A formally defined set of organizational rules governing execution authorization.



Policies define:



\* Required approvals

\* Constraints

\* Compliance obligations

\* Risk controls

\* Authorization conditions



See: `05-governance/POLICY\_MODEL.md`



\---



\# P



\## Parmana



An Execution Authorization and Verification Infrastructure for Enterprise AI.



Parmana enables organizations to deploy autonomous AI while ensuring that every high-impact action is authorized, policy-compliant, verifiable, and independently auditable.



\---



\## Policy Reference



A unique identifier that specifies which organizational policy governs an Execution Request.



Policy selection is explicit and deterministic.



See: `05-governance/POLICY\_REFERENCE.md`



\---



\# R



\## Replay



The process of re-evaluating a previously authorized Execution Request using its recorded evidence to verify that the authorization decision is reproducible.



See: `02-architecture/REPLAY.md`



\---



\## Repository



The abstraction responsible for storing and retrieving Parmana records independently of the underlying storage technology.



See: `02-architecture/REPOSITORY.md`



\---



\## Runtime



The execution environment that coordinates request processing, evidence collection, policy evaluation, authorization, receipt generation, and persistence.



See: `02-architecture/RUNTIME.md`



\---



\# S



\## Signal



A piece of information evaluated during Authority Verification.



Signals may originate from enterprise systems, AI systems, or human approvals.



See: `01-concepts/SIGNAL\_MODEL.md`



\---



\## System of Record



An enterprise system that serves as the authoritative source for a category of business information.



Examples include ERP, HR, IAM, Finance, and CRM systems.



See: `01-concepts/SIGNAL\_MODEL.md`



\---



\# T



\## Trust



Confidence established through verified evidence rather than assumption.



Within Parmana, trust is created by policy evaluation, evidence verification, and organizational authority.



\---



\# V



\## Verification



The process of confirming that an authorization decision is supported by complete, valid, and verifiable evidence.



Verification enables replay, audit, and independent validation.



See: `02-architecture/VERIFICATION.md`
