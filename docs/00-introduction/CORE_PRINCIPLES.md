\# Core Principles



\## Purpose



This document defines the fundamental principles that guide the design, implementation, and evolution of Parmana.



These principles are intentionally stable and technology-independent. They describe \*what Parmana stands for\* rather than \*how Parmana is implemented\*.



All architectural decisions, runtime behavior, APIs, and future extensions should remain consistent with these principles.



\---



\# Introduction



Parmana is built on the belief that enterprise AI requires a different foundation than traditional software.



The challenge is not simply enabling AI to perform work. The challenge is enabling organizations to trust AI execution.



Trust is established through governance, verification, evidence, and accountability—not through AI capability alone.



The following principles define the foundation of the Parmana platform.



\---



\# Principle 1 — Human Authority



Organizations retain ultimate authority over business operations.



AI systems may assist, recommend, plan, or propose actions, but they do not define organizational authority.



Authority is established by:



\* Organizational policy

\* Delegated business authority

\* Human approvals

\* Regulatory obligations

\* Contractual commitments



Parmana preserves this authority during every execution decision.



\---



\# Principle 2 — Policy Governs Execution



Every execution request is evaluated against explicit organizational policy.



Policy determines:



\* Whether execution is permitted

\* Which approvals are required

\* Which conditions must be satisfied

\* Which evidence must be verified

\* Which controls apply



AI capability never overrides organizational policy.



\---



\# Principle 3 — Trust Through Verification



Execution is never authorized solely because an AI system recommends an action.



Authorization requires verification.



Verification is based on trusted evidence rather than AI assertions.



Evidence may include:



\* Enterprise facts

\* Human approvals

\* Organizational policies

\* Verified execution context

\* AI-derived signals used as supporting information



Trust is established by verification, not assumption.



\---



\# Principle 4 — Enterprise Facts Are Authoritative



Enterprise systems of record remain the authoritative source for operational facts.



Examples include:



\* Identity systems

\* ERP platforms

\* Financial systems

\* HR systems

\* CRM platforms

\* Policy repositories



When authorization depends on business data, Parmana evaluates trusted enterprise facts rather than relying on AI-generated representations.



\---



\# Principle 5 — AI-Derived Signals Are Evidence, Not Authority



AI systems may produce valuable information such as:



\* Risk assessments

\* Intent classification

\* Document extraction

\* Anomaly detection

\* Recommendations



These outputs are treated as evidence that may inform an authorization decision.



They do not independently authorize execution.



\---



\# Principle 6 — Explicit Human Approval



When organizational policy requires human approval, that approval must be explicitly verified before execution.



Human approval cannot be inferred.



It cannot be substituted by AI confidence or model reasoning.



Parmana ensures that approval requirements are enforced consistently.



\---



\# Principle 7 — Deterministic Authorization



Given the same:



\* Execution request

\* Policy reference

\* Enterprise facts

\* Human approvals

\* AI-derived signals



Parmana should produce the same authorization decision.



Deterministic behavior supports:



\* Independent verification

\* Replay

\* Audit

\* Operational consistency



\---



\# Principle 8 — Separation of Reasoning and Authority



Reasoning and authorization are distinct responsibilities.



AI reasoning determines what action may be appropriate.



Authorization determines whether that action is permitted.



This separation ensures that execution authority remains under organizational governance rather than model behavior.



\---



\# Principle 9 — Independent Verification



Authorization decisions should be independently verifiable.



Verification should not depend on trusting:



\* The AI model

\* The application

\* The requesting service



Independent verification allows organizations to reproduce authorization decisions using recorded evidence.



\---



\# Principle 10 — Every Execution Produces Evidence



Every authorization decision should generate evidence describing:



\* The execution request

\* Applicable policy

\* Verified enterprise facts

\* Human approvals

\* Authorization outcome

\* Verification status



This evidence forms the basis for operational transparency and auditability.



\---



\# Principle 11 — Auditability by Design



Auditability is a core property of the platform.



Organizations should be able to determine:



\* What was requested

\* Why it was authorized

\* Which policy applied

\* Which evidence was evaluated

\* Who approved the action

\* When the decision occurred



These questions should be answerable without relying on undocumented system behavior.



\---



\# Principle 12 — Replayability



Authorization decisions should be reproducible.



Given the recorded execution request and associated evidence, organizations should be able to replay the authorization process to confirm that the recorded outcome remains consistent.



Replay supports:



\* Debugging

\* Compliance reviews

\* Incident investigations

\* Regression testing



\---



\# Principle 13 — Cryptographic Integrity



Execution evidence should be protected against unauthorized modification.



Cryptographic mechanisms ensure that recorded authorization evidence can be validated and that tampering can be detected.



Integrity protection strengthens confidence in verification and audit processes.



\---



\# Principle 14 — Platform Independence



Parmana is independent of:



\* AI model providers

\* Programming languages

\* Cloud providers

\* Workflow engines

\* Enterprise applications



Its responsibility is to evaluate execution authorization consistently regardless of where execution requests originate.



\---



\# Principle 15 — Composability



Parmana is designed to integrate with existing enterprise infrastructure rather than replace it.



It complements systems such as:



\* Identity providers

\* Policy engines

\* Workflow platforms

\* Enterprise applications

\* AI orchestration frameworks



Organizations can adopt Parmana incrementally without redesigning existing operational systems.



\---



\# Principle 16 — Governance Before Automation



Automation without governance increases operational risk.



Parmana ensures that governance precedes execution.



Execution authority is established before actions occur—not after they have already been performed.



\---



\# Summary



These principles define the permanent foundation of Parmana.



As the platform evolves, implementations may change, integrations may expand, and supported technologies may grow.



However, these principles remain constant:



\* Human authority governs execution.

\* Policy defines authorization.

\* Trust is established through verification.

\* Enterprise facts are authoritative.

\* AI-derived signals inform but do not authorize.

\* Human approvals are explicit.

\* Authorization is deterministic.

\* Verification is independent.

\* Every execution produces evidence.

\* Auditability is built into the system.

\* Replay validates authorization.

\* Cryptographic integrity protects evidence.

\* Parmana remains platform independent.

\* Governance precedes automation.



Together, these principles enable organizations to confidently deploy autonomous AI while retaining authority, accountability, and control over every high-impact execution.
