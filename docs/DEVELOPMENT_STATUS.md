\# Parmana Development Status (Architecture Lock v1)



\## Project Status



The core \*\*Execution Trust Lifecycle (v1)\*\* is complete and considered architecturally locked.



The following workflow is implemented and passing integration tests:



```

Business Transaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execute

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verify

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Receipt

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Replay

```



\---



\# Completed



\## Runtime

\* Execute

\* Verify

\* Receipt



\## Tests



Completed:



\* Workflow integration

\* Supabase workflow integration

\* Replay integration

\* Trust Record lifecycle integration

\* Trust Record retrieval integration

\* Negative-path tests

\* API validation tests



\---



\# Locked Architecture



The following components are frozen for v1.



\## Lifecycle



```

Execute

→ Verify

→ Receipt

→ Replay

```



\## Cryptographic Invariant



Exactly one canonical Trust Record hashing implementation exists:



```

VerificationCrypto

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

TrustRecordHasher

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

CanonicalSerializer

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

SHA-256

```



No other component should compute Trust Record hashes independently.



\## Replay



Replay is an integrity operation.



Replay:



\* loads an existing Trust Record

\* recomputes the canonical hash

\* verifies integrity

\* returns verification status



Replay never re-executes business logic.



\## Trust Record Hash



The Trust Record hash is computed only from immutable execution evidence.



Included:



\* trustRecordId

\* businessTransactionId

\* transaction

\* overrides

\* executions

\* createdAt



Excluded:



\* trustRecordHash

\* verifications

\* receipts

\* updatedAt



This invariant is locked for v1.

\# Remaining Roadmap



\## Phase 2 — Production Cryptography



\### Persistent Key Management



Implement:



```

packages/crypto/src/providers/key/

```



including:



\* FileKeyProvider

\* KeyProvider abstraction



\### Key Generation CLI



Create:



```

packages/crypto/scripts/generate-keypair.ts

```



Capabilities:



\* generate Ed25519 keypair

\* export private.pem

\* export public.pem



\### CryptoBootstrap



Replace ephemeral keys with persistent keys.



\---



\## Phase 3



Key Rotation



Support:



\* multiple signing keys

\* active key selection

\* receipt key identifiers



\---



\## Phase 4



Multi-tenant Signing



Support:



\* tenant-specific key providers

\* tenant isolation



\---



\## Phase 5



Cloud Key Providers



Implement providers for:



\* AWS KMS

\* Azure Key Vault

\* Google Cloud KMS

\* HashiCorp Vault

\* HSM



No changes should be required in Ed25519SignatureProvider.



\---



\# Repository Status



Current state:



\* Core lifecycle complete

\* Architecture locked

\* Stable v1 implementation

\* Ready for production-grade key management



Future work must extend the architecture without changing the v1 lifecycle or Trust Record hashing model.
