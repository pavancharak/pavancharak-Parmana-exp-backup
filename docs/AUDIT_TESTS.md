\# Testing Audit



\*\*Version:\*\* v1 Foundation  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-07-03



\---



\# Purpose



This document audits the testing strategy of the Parmana Execution Trust Platform.



The objective is to evaluate whether the platform correctly validates its core Execution Trust capabilities through automated testing.



\---



\# Testing Objectives



The testing strategy is designed to verify:



\- Correct execution

\- Deterministic behavior

\- Cryptographic integrity

\- Persistent storage

\- Repository reconstruction

\- Verification

\- Receipt generation

\- Replay

\- REST API correctness



\---



\# Testing Philosophy



Parmana prioritizes \*\*end-to-end integration testing\*\* over isolated unit testing for the core Execution Trust lifecycle.



This approach validates that all architectural layers work together correctly.



```

REST API



↓



Runtime



↓



Repository



↓



Storage



↓



Cryptography

```



\---



\# Current Test Coverage



The platform includes automated tests for:



\- Business Transaction execution

\- Execution Trust Record creation

\- Verification

\- Receipt generation

\- Replay

\- Repository persistence

\- Cryptographic verification

\- REST API endpoints



\---



\# Integration Testing



Integration tests validate the complete platform.



Current workflow tested:



```

Business Transaction



↓



Execute



↓



Execution Trust Record



↓



Verify



↓



Receipt



↓



Replay

```



Each stage is executed against the actual Runtime, Storage, and Cryptography layers.

Replay confirms that historical execution evidence remains valid.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\# Repository Testing



Repository tests validate:



\- Trust Record creation

\- Execution persistence

\- Verification persistence

\- Receipt persistence

\- Aggregate reconstruction



Repository reconstruction is exercised through integration tests.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\# Cryptography Testing



Validated:



\- Canonical serialization

\- SHA-256 hashing

\- Ed25519 signing

\- Signature verification

\- Receipt signatures



Current implementation successfully verifies cryptographic integrity.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\# REST API Testing



Current endpoints tested:



```

POST /execute



POST /verify



POST /receipt



POST /replay

```



Tests validate:



\- request handling

\- response generation

\- Runtime integration

\- persistence

\- replay



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\# Storage Testing



Validated:



\- Supabase persistence

\- Trust Record reconstruction

\- Artifact retrieval

\- Immutable history

\- Replay support



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\# Error Handling Tests



Current coverage includes:



\- Missing Trust Records

\- Invalid requests

\- Verification failures

\- Receipt generation failures



Additional negative-path testing can be expanded in future releases.



\---



\# Determinism Testing



Current tests verify:



\- identical Trust Record hashes

\- deterministic replay

\- signature consistency

\- canonical serialization



Deterministic execution is a core property of the platform.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\# Test Infrastructure



Current testing tools:



\- Vitest

\- Supertest



Tests execute against the complete Runtime and Storage implementation.



No mocking is required for the primary execution lifecycle.



\---



\# Strengths



\- End-to-end lifecycle testing

\- Real storage integration

\- Real cryptographic verification

\- Deterministic replay validation

\- Repository reconstruction validation

\- REST API coverage

\- Automated execution



\---



\# Future Test Enhancements



Planned additions include:



\- Performance tests

\- Load tests

\- Concurrency tests

\- Stress tests

\- Fuzz testing

\- Property-based testing

\- Multi-tenant testing

\- Security testing

\- Chaos testing

\- Disaster recovery testing

\# Conclusion



The Parmana v1 Foundation has comprehensive automated validation for the complete Execution Trust lifecycle.



The testing strategy demonstrates that Business Transactions can be executed, verified, receipted, persisted, and deterministically replayed while maintaining cryptographic integrity.



The platform's most critical functionality is validated through end-to-end integration tests using the actual Runtime, Repository, Storage, and Cryptography implementations.



Future testing efforts will focus on scalability, security, resilience, and enterprise operational scenarios.
