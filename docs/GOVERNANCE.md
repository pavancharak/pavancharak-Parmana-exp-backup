\# Parmana Governance



Version: 1.0



Status: Normative



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the governance principles that preserve the integrity, stability, and evolution of the Parmana Execution Trust Infrastructure.



Governance ensures that changes to the architecture, specification, and implementation do not weaken execution trust.



\---



\# Governance Objectives



Parmana governance is designed to ensure:



\* architectural stability

\* deterministic behavior

\* backward compatibility where practical

\* verifiable evolution

\* evidence-backed technical claims



Every change should strengthen or preserve execution trust.



\---



\# Governance Principles



\## Trust Before Features



New features MUST NOT weaken the execution trust model.



Execution trust takes precedence over feature velocity.



\---



\## Explicit Evolution



Architectural changes MUST be documented.



Breaking changes MUST include:



\* rationale

\* migration strategy

\* compatibility impact



\---



\## Specification First



Normative behavior is defined by `SPECIFICATION.md`.



The implementation MUST conform to the specification.



When conflicts arise, the specification is authoritative.



\---



\## Guarantees Before Claims



Public claims MUST be supported by documented guarantees.



Guarantees MUST be supported by implementation evidence.



\---



\## Evidence Before Marketing



Technical capabilities SHOULD be documented only after they are:



\* implemented

\* tested

\* audited

\* documented



\---



\# Versioning



Parmana follows semantic versioning.



\## Major Version



A major version MAY introduce breaking architectural or specification changes.



Major versions require:



\* updated specification

\* updated guarantees

\* updated proofs

\* migration documentation



\---



\## Minor Version



Minor versions MAY introduce:



\* new capabilities

\* new APIs

\* optional features



Minor versions MUST preserve existing guarantees unless explicitly documented.



\---



\## Patch Version



Patch releases SHOULD contain:



\* bug fixes

\* security fixes

\* documentation corrections

\* implementation improvements



Patch releases MUST NOT change normative behavior.



\---



\# Change Categories



\## Architectural Changes



Examples:



\* runtime architecture

\* trust model

\* execution lifecycle



Require:



\* architecture review

\* guarantee review

\* updated proofs



\---



\## Specification Changes



Require:



\* specification update

\* conformance review

\* migration guidance if applicable



\---



\## Security Changes



Require:



\* security review

\* audit

\* regression testing



\---



\## Documentation Changes



Documentation SHOULD remain synchronized with the implementation.



\---



\# Guarantee Governance



Every guarantee SHALL have:



\* implementation

\* documented proof

\* automated tests

\* audit evidence



Guarantees SHOULD NOT be removed without replacing their functionality or documenting the impact.



\---



\# Policy Governance



Business policies are external to Parmana.



Parmana governs:



\* policy references

\* policy loading

\* policy validation

\* policy execution



Parmana does not govern the business content of individual policies.



\---



\# Runtime Governance



The production runtime SHOULD execute the canonical trust pipeline.



Future architectural changes MUST preserve the integrity of the execution trust chain.



\---



\# Security Governance



Security-related changes SHOULD include:



\* threat analysis

\* regression tests

\* documentation updates



Cryptographic changes SHOULD preserve compatibility where possible or provide a documented migration path.



\---



\# Release Governance



A release is considered complete only when:



\* implementation is complete

\* automated tests pass

\* guarantees are updated

\* proofs are updated

\* release checklist is satisfied



\---



\# Decision Process



Architectural decisions SHOULD be guided by the following questions:



1\. Does this strengthen execution trust?

2\. Does this preserve deterministic behavior?

3\. Does this improve verifiability?

4\. Does this maintain architectural clarity?

5\. Can the resulting behavior be independently verified?



Changes that weaken these properties require explicit justification.



\---



\# Governance Artifacts



The following documents collectively define Parmana governance:



\* VISION.md

\* ARCHITECTURE.md

\* SPECIFICATION.md

\* CLAIMS.md

\* GUARANTEES.md

\* PROOFS.md

\* SECURITY.md

\* CONFORMANCE.md

\* LIFECYCLE.md

\* RELEASE\_CHECKLIST.md



\---



\# Guiding Principle



Parmana evolves through disciplined, evidence-backed engineering.



Execution trust is preserved by governance, demonstrated by implementation, and validated through testing, audit, and independent verification.
