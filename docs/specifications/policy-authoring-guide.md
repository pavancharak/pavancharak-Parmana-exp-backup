\# Policy Authoring Guide



Version: 1.0.0



Status: Canonical



\---



\# Purpose



This guide defines how execution authorization policies are authored in Parmana.



Policies describe deterministic business authorization logic.



Policies SHALL NOT contain application code.



Policies SHALL NOT perform execution.



Policies SHALL NOT contain side effects.

\# Policy Anatomy



Every policy consists of:



\- metadata

\- signals schema

\- ordered rules



\---



\# Metadata



Required



\- policyId

\- policyVersion

\- schemaVersion

\- title

\- description

\- owner

\- category

\- classification



\---



\# Signals



Policies consume runtime signals.



Signals represent facts known at evaluation time.



Examples



\- riskScore

\- humanApproval

\- amount

\- currency

\- repository

\- environment



Signals SHALL be immutable during evaluation.



\---



\# Rules



Rules are evaluated sequentially.



First matching rule wins.



Rules SHALL NOT overlap unnecessarily.



\---



\# Conditions



Leaf



{

&#x20;   "fact": "riskScore",

&#x20;   "operator": "lte",

&#x20;   "value": 25

}



Logical AND



{

&#x20;   "all": \[

&#x20;       ...

&#x20;   ]

}



Logical OR



{

&#x20;   "any": \[

&#x20;       ...

&#x20;   ]

}



Always



{

&#x20;   "always": true

}



\---



\# Operators



Document every supported operator with examples.



Equality



Numeric



Collections



Strings



Existence



Boolean



Null



Length



Type



\---



\# Outcomes



Approve



Require Override



Reject



Every outcome SHALL include an audit-quality reason.



\---



\# Rule Design Guidelines



Prefer simple rules.



Split complex business logic into multiple rules.



Avoid deeply nested conditions.



Prefer explicit signals over implicit behavior.



\---



\# Rule Ordering



Recommended



Approve



↓



Require Override

Reject

Default Reject



\---



\# Default Rule



Every policy SHALL end with



{

&#x20;   "condition": {

&#x20;       "always": true

&#x20;   }

}



No rules SHALL follow.



\---



\# Determinism Requirements



Policies SHALL NOT



\- use current time

\- use random values

\- call external APIs

\- query databases

\- invoke LLMs



Policies SHALL evaluate only supplied runtime signals.



\---



\# Replay Requirements



Given identical



\- policy

\- signals

\- engine version



evaluation SHALL produce identical results.



\---



\# Validation Checklist



Before publishing a policy verify:



✓ Metadata complete



✓ Signals declared



✓ Operators supported



✓ Default rule exists



✓ Reasons provided



✓ PolicyValidator passes



✓ Replay deterministic



\---



\# Style Guide



Use business terminology.



Avoid implementation details.



Write audit-friendly reasons.



Use consistent rule identifiers.



Prefer positive approval rules followed by explicit rejection rules.



\---



\# Example Policy



Provide one complete production-quality policy demonstrating every convention.
