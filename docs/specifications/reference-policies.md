\# Parmana Reference Policy Specification



Version: 1.0.0



Status: Canonical



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the canonical structure and quality requirements for the reference policies distributed with Parmana.



Reference policies demonstrate recommended enterprise policy authoring practices and serve as templates for customer-defined policies.



\---



\# Objectives



Reference policies SHALL:



\- demonstrate deterministic policy evaluation

\- demonstrate execution authorization

\- be replayable

\- be independently verifiable

\- be suitable for production deployment

\- pass PolicyValidator without modification



\---



\# Canonical Policy Library



The reference policy library consists of:



\- access-control

\- customer-refund

\- database-change

\- github-pr-approval

\- llm-tool-call

\- production-deployment

\- rag-document-access

\- vendor-payment



\---



\# Canonical Policy Structure



Every policy SHALL contain:



{

&#x20;   policyId

&#x20;   policyVersion

&#x20;   schemaVersion

&#x20;   title

&#x20;   description

&#x20;   owner

&#x20;   category

&#x20;   classification

&#x20;   signalsSchema

&#x20;   rules

}



\---



\# Metadata



\## policyId



Unique policy identifier.



Immutable.



\---



\## policyVersion



Business version.



Semantic versioning.



\---



\## schemaVersion



Policy language version.



\---



\## title



Human-readable policy name.



\---



\## description



Business description.



Describes governance intent rather than implementation.



\---



\## owner



Policy owner.



Example:



Parmana



\---



\## category



Example values:



Execution Authorization



AI Execution Authorization



Deployment Governance



Access Governance



\---



\## classification



Example values:



Reference



Customer



Enterprise



Internal



\---



\# Signals Schema



Every policy SHALL explicitly declare every runtime signal.



Example:



{

&#x20; "riskScore": "number",

&#x20; "humanApproval": "boolean",

&#x20; "resourceAuthorized": "boolean"

}



Signals SHALL be validated before policy evaluation.



\---



\# Rules



Rules SHALL be evaluated in document order.



The first matching rule SHALL determine the policy outcome.



\---



\# Canonical Rule Ordering



Policies SHOULD follow this structure:



1\. Approval rules



2\. Require Override rules (optional)



3\. Reject rules



4\. Default rule



\---



\# Default Rule



The final rule SHALL be:



{

&#x20; "condition": {

&#x20;   "always": true

&#x20; }

}



No rules shall appear after an always condition.



\---



\# Rule Identifiers



Rule identifiers SHOULD follow a consistent naming convention.



Examples:



approve-access



approve-refund



require-human-review



reject-high-risk



reject-unauthorized



default-reject



\---



\# Policy Conditions



Supported condition types:



Leaf



{

&#x20; "fact": "...",

&#x20; "operator": "...",

&#x20; "value": ...

}



AND



{

&#x20; "all": \[ ... ]

}



OR



{

&#x20; "any": \[ ... ]

}



Always



{

&#x20; "always": true

}



No other condition types are permitted.



\---



\# Supported Operators



Equality



eq

neq



Numeric



gt

gte

lt

lte

between



Collection



in

not\_in



contains

not\_contains



contains\_all

contains\_any



String



starts\_with

ends\_with

matches



Existence



exists

not\_exists



Boolean



is\_true

is\_false



Null



is\_null

is\_not\_null



Length



length\_eq

length\_gt

length\_gte

length\_lt

length\_lte



Type



type\_is



\---



\# Outcome Reasons



Outcome reasons SHALL be suitable for audit records.



Reasons SHOULD explain the governance decision.



Examples:



Execution authorized. All required governance conditions were satisfied.



Execution rejected because the assessed risk exceeds the maximum permitted threshold.



Execution rejected because the requested operation is not authorized.



\---



\# Determinism



Reference policies SHALL be deterministic.



Policy evaluation SHALL NOT depend upon:



\- clocks

\- randomness

\- databases

\- network requests

\- LLMs

\- external services



All external information SHALL be supplied as runtime signals.



\---



\# Replay Guarantee



Given:



\- identical policy

\- identical signals

\- identical engine version



evaluation SHALL produce:



\- identical outcome

\- identical reason

\- identical matched rule

\- identical evaluation trace



\---



\# Validation



Every reference policy SHALL:



\- pass PolicyValidator

\- declare all signals

\- use only canonical operators

\- contain a default rule

\- be replay-safe
