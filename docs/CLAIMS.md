# Parmana Technical Claims



Version: 1.0



Status: Public



---



# Key Compromise Notice



The default signing key (`keys/default.private.pem` / `keys/default.public.pem`) was publicly exposed in a Parmana Systems GitHub repository prior to 2026-07-05 (incident record: `04-INCIDENTS-LOG.md`, INC-1). This repository's own commit history does not carry that exposure (no `.pem` private key was ever committed here), but the key itself must still be treated as permanently compromised regardless of which repository exposed it.



All signatures produced by that key are void for authenticity purposes, regardless of when the signed artifact was created.



The key pair was rotated on 2026-07-05.

# 1. Core Positioning



## Category



Parmana is **Execution Trust Infrastructure**.



## Mission



Trust in what an AI agent did should not have to rest on hoping it behaved. It should be a verifiable record. Parmana establishes that record through an explicit chain: authorize, verify, execute, confirm, connecting business authorization, policy evaluation, runtime execution, and execution evidence.



## Value Proposition



Parmana enables organizations to verify what automated systems executed, not simply trust that they executed correctly.



---



# Purpose



This document defines the public technical claims that Parmana makes about its architecture and capabilities: the authorize → verify → execute → confirm chain above, made specific and checkable.



Claims are categorized according to the level of implementation evidence available.



A technical claim SHOULD be promoted only when supported by:



* implementation

* automated tests

* audit evidence

* documented proofs

* independent verification (where applicable)



---



# 2. Supported Technical Claims



The following claims are supported by the current implementation and architecture.



---



## 2.1 Trusted Business Transactions



Parmana validates Business Transactions before execution.



Business Transactions are checked for internal trust-chain consistency before entering the runtime.



Evidence



* BusinessTransactionValidator

* G-01 Trusted Business Transaction



---



## 2.2 Deterministic Policy Selection



Parmana executes exactly one explicitly referenced business policy.



The runtime loads the policy identified by the Business Transaction and validates its identity before evaluation.



The runtime does not:



* discover policies

* negotiate policies

* automatically select the latest version

* substitute alternative policies



Evidence



* PolicyRouter

* PolicyValidator

* G-02 Deterministic Policy Selection



---



## 2.3 Deterministic Policy Evaluation



Parmana deterministically evaluates business policies using sequential rule evaluation with first-match semantics.



Evaluation records include:



* matched rule

* decision reason

* evaluation trace



Evidence



* PolicyEngine

* G-03 Deterministic Policy Evaluation



---



## 2.4 Authorized Execution



Parmana prevents execution when required trust artifacts are missing or when the decision outcome is not approved.



Evidence



* TrustChainValidationComponent

* RuntimeEngine

* G-04 Authorized Execution



---



## 2.5 Verifiable Execution Evidence



Parmana generates cryptographically verifiable execution evidence.



Execution produces:



* Execution Trust Records

* Canonical Trust Record hashes

* Signed Receipts



Evidence



* BusinessTrustRecordBuilder (renamed from ExecutionTrustRecordBuilder)

* ExecutionComponent, ExecutionEvidenceBuilder (packages/runtime/src/{components/ExecutionComponent,ExecutionEvidenceBuilder}.ts) — the live pipeline stage that builds and attaches ExecutionEvidence to every Execution, called by RuntimeFactory-constructed Runtimes; not to be confused with ExecutionEvidenceComponent, a same-named-in-spirit stub confirmed unwired and deleted (docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md G-26)

* ReceiptService (packages/runtime/src/services/receipt-service.ts), called directly by ExecutionTrustApplication.execute() on every successful execution

* VerificationCrypto

* ReceiptCrypto

* packages/runtime/tests/integration/receipt.integration.test.ts, receipt-hybrid.integration.test.ts

* G-05

* G-06



---



## 2.6 Independent Verification



Parmana supports independent verification of execution evidence.



Verification can confirm execution integrity using the generated execution artifacts.



Evidence



* packages/runtime/src/services/verification-service.ts

* packages/runtime/test/verification-service.test.ts

* VerificationCrypto

* G-07



---



## 2.7 Replay Support



Parmana supports replay of recorded execution decisions for verification and analysis, via the standalone `@parmana/replay` package (`ReplayEngine`), which re-evaluates a recorded policy decision against its recorded signals and reports whether the outcome matches.

**Scope note (independently verified, Phase 2G):** this is a package-level capability, not yet wired into the HTTP API. `POST /replay` exists and returns 200, but its actual implementation (`ExecutionTrustApplication.replay()`) performs a signature/hash recheck of the stored Trust Record — the same category of check as `/verify` — not a call into `@parmana/replay`. Both behaviors are real and tested; they are simply two different things sharing the word "replay." See `docs/site/replay/overview.mdx` for the full disambiguation and `docs/architecture/phase2g-replay-semantics.md` for the independent verification, call graphs, and regression tests establishing this as the current, intentional, and separately production-contracted (both SDKs are typed against `POST /replay`'s current response shape) behavior — not an unwired bug awaiting a fix.

Evidence

* Replay package (packages/replay/src/ReplayEngine.ts)

* G-08

* docs/architecture/phase2g-replay-semantics.md



---



## 2.8 Signed, Single-Use, Time-Bounded Execution Authorization



Every approved execution request carries a cryptographically signed Execution Authorization scoped to one decision, bound to a single-use nonce, and valid only within a bounded time window (Ed25519 by default; ML-DSA-65 / FIPS 204 configurable via SIGNATURE_PROVIDER).



Evidence



* AuthorizationSigner

* AuthorizationVerifier

* EnvelopeVerifier

* MemoryNonceStore

* packages/crypto/test/authorization-envelope.test.ts

* packages/envelope-verifier/test/envelope-verifier.test.ts



---



## 2.9 Independent Envelope Verification



A receiving system can independently verify that Parmana authorized an execution request without trusting Parmana's runtime process or its database. Verification requires only Parmana's public key and the envelope itself.



Evidence



* @parmana/envelope-verifier (EnvelopeVerifier, requireParmanaAuthorization)

* packages/envelope-verifier/README.md ("Claims" section)



---



## 2.10 Rejection of Forged, Tampered, Expired, and Replayed Authorizations



The receiving system rejects a forged signature, a tampered payload, an expired envelope, and a replayed (previously accepted) envelope. Replay protection is scoped to whichever NonceStore instance performs the check; see 3.2 below.



Evidence



* packages/envelope-verifier/tests/unit/envelope-verifier.test.ts: "a forged envelope does not burn the nonce", "an expired envelope does not burn the nonce", "rejects a second use of the same nonce", "treats the exact expiresAt instant as expired (boundary is exclusive, not inclusive)", "under two concurrent verify() calls with one nonce, exactly one succeeds (deterministic, not flaky)"



---



## 2.11 Trust Record Bound to Its Authorization



The Execution Trust Record's authorizationId is part of the canonical content that is hashed and signed, not merely attached alongside it. Tampering with it changes the recomputed Trust Record hash.



Evidence



* BusinessTrustRecordBuilder (renamed from ExecutionTrustRecordBuilder)

* packages/runtime/test/execution-authorization-wiring.test.ts: "trust record references the authorization"



---



## 2.12 Fail-Closed Authorization on Rejection



A rejected Decision never produces a Signed Execution Authorization.



Evidence



* RuntimeEngine (authorization signing occurs only after executionGate.enforce() approves the Decision)

* packages/runtime/test/execution-authorization-wiring.test.ts: "rejected transaction produces no authorization"



---



## 2.13 Key/Algorithm Binding Guard



Signing or verifying with key material of the wrong type (for example, an Ed25519 key against the configured ML-DSA-65 provider, or vice versa) fails closed with a clear error naming both the expected and actual key type, rather than silently dispatching on the key's own type.



Evidence



* assertKeyType (used by Ed25519SignatureProvider and Dilithium3SignatureProvider)

* packages/crypto/test/SignatureProvider.test.ts



---



## 2.14 Configurable Post-Quantum Signing (ML-DSA-65)



Post-quantum signing (ML-DSA-65, FIPS 204, historically referred to in this codebase as "dilithium3") is selectable via SIGNATURE_PROVIDER, using the same PEM-based persistent key mechanism as the default Ed25519 provider (FileKeyProvider, keyId "default"). Requires Node >= 24 for native node:crypto ml-dsa-65 support. Selecting it with missing or mismatched key material fails closed rather than silently regenerating or substituting different keys.



Evidence



* Dilithium3SignatureProvider

* FileKeyProvider

* generate-keypair.ts (--algorithm dilithium3)

* packages/crypto/test/Dilithium3SignatureProvider.test.ts

* packages/crypto/test/dilithium3-cross-instance.test.ts



---



## 2.15 Authorization-Binding Verification



Every APPROVED execution in a verified Execution Trust Record must carry a non-empty authorizationId in its metadata; absence fails verification and names the execution. REJECTED-decision executions are not required to carry one. All checks (integrity, signature, authorization binding) run unconditionally and independently: a single failure never suppresses reporting of the others.



Evidence



* VerificationService (packages/runtime/src/services/verification-service.ts)

* packages/runtime/tests/unit/verification-service.test.ts: all 6 cases

* packages/runtime/tests/unit/verification-negative.test.ts: always-running, in-memory: fails on a mutated transaction payload field, a mutated signature value, and a mutated executions hash-chain-array element

* packages/api/tests/integration/verification-negative.integration.test.ts: "reports FAILED when the persisted record is tampered after execution" (additional citation; Supabase-gated, does not run without live credentials)



---



## 2.16 Caller Authentication at the API Boundary



Every route except `/health`, `/ready`, `/openapi.yaml`, `/documentation`, `POST /refusal/verify`, and `POST /audit/verify` requires a valid caller credential (`packages/api/src/app.ts`). The first four are liveness/readiness probes and API documentation; the last two are deliberately unauthenticated, independently third-party-verifiable signature-verification capabilities (RFC-0021 Refusal Record verification and caller-audit/webhook-audit signature verification, see 3.11), not routes that expose any caller's data. createApp's callerAuth option is mandatory: it accepts either an authenticator/auditSink pair or the literal string "disabled", so every call site states its choice explicitly; there is no default that silently mounts the API with no caller authentication. Production (server.ts) refuses to start with PARMANA_AUTH_DISABLED unset and no PARMANA_API_KEYS configured (2.17). A key valid for one caller does not grant a different caller's identity, and every accept/reject outcome is audited without ever recording the raw key. In production, that audit trail is durable (see 3.2's sibling claim for the NonceStore side of the same fix), backed by Supabase and shared across every process, not scoped to one process's uptime; `createCallerAuditSink.ts` fails closed at startup if Supabase is not configured. `InMemoryCallerAuditSink` remains available and correct for tests (NODE_ENV=test).

**Precise scope of `PARMANA_AUTH_DISABLED=true` (docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md G-28):** this flag, when explicitly opted into, removes *caller identity and accountability only* — `RuntimeEngine`, `PolicyEngine`, `CapabilityPolicyBinder`, `SignalIntentBinder`, and every `SignalStateVerifier` never read the caller-auth middleware's output at all (confirmed by direct grep: zero references to caller identity anywhere in those files), so *action-level authorization* (whether a specific `razorpay:refund-create`/`hubspot:deal-update` request is itself authorized) remains fully enforced regardless of this flag. It does not disable the authorization boundary this document's other claims describe; it disables knowing who asked.



Evidence



* packages/api/src/app.ts (CallerAuthOption: "disabled" | { authenticator, auditSink }, required, no default)

* packages/api/src/bootstrap/createCallerAuthenticator.ts

* packages/api/src/bootstrap/createCallerAuditSink.ts (production wiring; fails closed when Supabase is not configured)

* packages/api/src/auth/StaticKeyAuthenticator.ts

* packages/api/src/auth/SupabaseCallerAuditSink.ts / InMemoryCallerAuditSink.ts

* packages/api/tests/integration/supabase-caller-audit-sink.integration.test.ts: a recorded event is read back through a second, independent client

* packages/api/tests/integration/caller-auth.integration.test.ts (valid/missing/invalid credential, scoping and revocation, audit trail content never contains the raw key, composition with policy evaluation, full route inventory)

* packages/api/tests/unit/bootstrap/create-caller-authenticator.test.ts



---



## 2.17 Fail-Closed Startup Configuration Validation



Parmana refuses to start rather than let missing required configuration surface later as an unstructured runtime error. This applies to caller authentication keys (PARMANA_API_KEYS, unless PARMANA_AUTH_DISABLED=true is set explicitly), the policy directory (PARMANA_POLICY_DIR), and, in production wiring, the durable NonceStore and CallerAuditSink's Supabase configuration alike: all fail at startup with an error naming the missing variable, rather than PARMANA_POLICY_DIR surfacing as an unhandled ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE inside FilePolicyRepository.load at request time, or a NonceStore/CallerAuditSink silently degrading to an in-memory implementation.



Evidence



* packages/api/src/bootstrap/createCallerAuthenticator.ts

* packages/shared/src/config/Config.ts (requirePolicyDirectory)

* packages/api/src/bootstrap/assertSupabaseConfigured.ts, used by createNonceStore.ts and createCallerAuditSink.ts

* packages/shared/tests/unit/config.test.ts: "refuses to start when PARMANA_POLICY_DIR is unset", "refuses to start when PARMANA_POLICY_DIR is blank"

* packages/api/tests/unit/bootstrap/create-caller-authenticator.test.ts

* packages/api/tests/unit/bootstrap/create-nonce-store.test.ts, create-caller-audit-sink.test.ts: "fails closed with a named, actionable error when NODE_ENV is not test and Supabase is not configured", "never silently falls back" to the in-memory implementation



---



## 2.18 Key Provider Input Validation



FileKeyProvider rejects any keyId that does not match ^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$ before constructing a filesystem path from it, closing the path-traversal surface a crafted keyId (for example, containing "../") would otherwise open against the configured key directory.



Evidence



* packages/crypto/src/providers/key/FileKeyProvider.ts (assertValidKeyId)

* packages/crypto/tests/unit/file-key-provider.test.ts: rejects a path-traversal keyId in getPrivateKey, getPublicKey, hasKey, and getMetadata



---



## 2.19 Fail-Closed Caller-Authentication Audit Writes



A caller-authentication event (accepted or rejected) that fails to be recorded fails the request. `middleware/caller-auth.ts` wraps every `CallerAuditSink.record()` call: on success the request proceeds exactly as before; on failure the request is rejected with `AuditUnavailableError` (503, code `AUDIT_UNAVAILABLE`) and a structured log entry naming the failure, rather than proceeding unaudited or crashing as an unhandled rejection. This is a deliberate design decision (an action that executes without an audit record contradicts independently verifiable execution), not an incidental side effect; the availability cost is accepted. No retry, buffering, or queueing exists: a failure fails closed immediately, once, every time.



Evidence



* packages/api/src/middleware/caller-auth.ts (recordOrFailClosed)

* packages/api/src/auth/AuditUnavailableError.ts

* packages/api/tests/unit/middleware/caller-auth.test.ts: both success paths unchanged; both failure paths rejected with `AuditUnavailableError` (503/AUDIT_UNAVAILABLE), not a 401 and not a silent pass-through; the structured log entry's exact shape; the sink is called exactly once (no retry)

* packages/api/tests/unit/supabase-caller-audit-sink.test.ts: `SupabaseCallerAuditSink` propagates storage errors rather than swallowing them, which is what makes this guard reachable in production wiring



---



## 2.20 Atomic Rejection of Duplicate Business Transactions



Creating a Business Transaction with a `businessTransactionId` that already exists is rejected atomically, with the identical `DuplicateBusinessTransactionError` regardless of storage backend. `MemoryBusinessTransactionRepository.create()` performs its existence check and its write in the same synchronous tick, with no `await` between them, so two concurrent calls for the same id cannot interleave; `SupabaseBusinessTransactionRepository.create()` relies on the `business_transaction_id` column's `PRIMARY KEY` constraint and maps the resulting `23505` unique-violation to the same error class. Neither implementation ever silently overwrites an existing transaction.



Evidence



* packages/storage/src/memory/MemoryBusinessTransactionRepository.ts

* packages/storage/src/supabase/SupabaseBusinessTransactionRepository.ts (isUniqueViolation mapping)

* packages/shared/src/errors/duplicate-business-transaction-error.ts

* packages/storage/tests/unit/memory-business-transaction-repository.test.ts: two simultaneous `create()` calls with the same id and different content: exactly one succeeds, the other rejects with `DuplicateBusinessTransactionError`, and the stored record is exactly the winner's

* packages/storage/tests/unit/business-transaction-repository-duplicate-consistency.test.ts: both repository implementations throw the identical error class and message for a duplicate

* packages/storage/tests/integration/supabase-business-transaction-duplicate.integration.test.ts: the same concurrent-race proof against a real Postgres database (Supabase-gated)



---



## 2.21 Distinguishable HTTP Status for Policy Denial and Replay



A policy `REJECTED` decision surfaces as `HTTP 403` with `code: "POLICY_DENIED"`. An execution request whose authorization envelope has already been consumed, meaning every other Gateway check (version, signature, expiry, TTL policy, `businessTransactionHash`) passed and nonce consumption alone failed, surfaces as `HTTP 409` with `code: "NONCE_ALREADY_CONSUMED"`. Both are now distinguishable from a genuine, unexpected server error, which remains `HTTP 500`. Neither the authorization logic nor any underlying check changed to produce this: only the status code and response body surfaced to the caller changed. Every other Gateway verification failure (forged signature, expired envelope, tampered content) is unaffected and remains a plain, uncoded error, still surfacing as `HTTP 500`.



Scope, precisely: the `409` path is reachable today only by a receiving system calling `@parmana/execution-gateway`'s `ExecutionGateway.execute()` directly with an already-consumed authorization (the library-level guarantee this closes). It is not reachable through Parmana's own default `POST /execute` / `POST /transactions` routes, because a resubmitted `businessTransactionId` is rejected with the existing `409` `DuplicateBusinessTransactionError` (2.20) before `RuntimeEngine`, policy evaluation, or the Gateway are ever reached — the same admission-time layer this repository's now-removed Razorpay connector relied on for its own live idempotency proof, documented in this file until the connector's removal on 2026-08-12; see `docs/site/changelog.mdx` for the dated record.



Evidence



* packages/runtime/src/ExecutionGate.ts (`RuntimeError` thrown with `status: 403, code: "POLICY_DENIED"`)

* packages/shared/src/errors/nonce-already-consumed-error.ts (`NonceAlreadyConsumedError`, `status: 409, code: "NONCE_ALREADY_CONSUMED"`)

* packages/execution-gateway/src/ExecutionGateway.ts (`isSoleFailureNonceReplay`: throws `NonceAlreadyConsumedError` only when every check other than nonce consumption passed; any other combination of failed checks still throws the existing, unchanged, uncoded `Error`)

* packages/api/src/middleware/error-handler.ts (dedicated `NonceAlreadyConsumedError` branch; the existing `RuntimeError` branch reads `error.status`/`error.code` dynamically, unchanged)

* packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/execution-gateway.test.ts, execution-gateway.dilithium3.test.ts: "rejects a replayed request without releasing it twice, as a distinguishable NonceAlreadyConsumedError (409)"

* packages/runtime/tests/unit/execution-authorization-wiring.test.ts: "rejected transaction produces no authorization" (asserts `status: 403`, `code: "POLICY_DENIED"`)

* packages/api/tests/integration/caller-auth.integration.test.ts: "a well-authenticated caller submitting a policy-rejected transaction is still rejected by policy" (asserts `response.status === 403`, `response.body.code === "POLICY_DENIED"`, through the real `POST /execute` route)

* packages/api/tests/integration/razorpay-refund.integration.test.ts, razorpay-live.integration.test.ts: the same `403`/`POLICY_DENIED` assertion for a Razorpay-refund-specific policy denial through the real production bootstrap chain

* typescript/src/transport/mapHttpErrorResponse.ts, typescript/test/Errors.test.ts, typescript/test/HttpTransport.test.ts: the TypeScript SDK maps `code: "POLICY_DENIED"` to `ExecutionRejectedError`, checked ahead of the generic `403` → `AuthorizationError` mapping so it does not collide with the unrelated caller-identity-mismatch `403` (`packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts`), which carries no `code` at all



---



## 2.22 Canonical Capability-to-Policy Binding (TD-22)



For every production capability, the policy that governs it is fixed structurally, not selected by the caller. `CapabilityPolicyBinder` checks a request's declared `Intent.action` against `CANONICAL_CAPABILITY_POLICY_BINDINGS`, a single hardcoded map from capability to the one policy reference that authorizes it (`packages/policy/src/CapabilityPolicyBinding.ts`) — covering every capability the production connector registry actually registers. A request pairing a real capability with any policy other than its canonical one is rejected as an ordinary policy denial, with zero rules evaluated, before `PolicyEngine.evaluate` ever runs.



This closes the gap that would otherwise exist because policy *loading* (`FilePolicyRepository.load(name, version)`) is itself keyed by whatever `policy.name`/`policy.version` the caller declares — validated only against a path-traversal allowlist, not against the capability being executed. Without the binder, a caller could pair a real, fund-moving or record-mutating capability (e.g. `razorpay:refund-create`) with an unrelated, unprotected policy that has no `boundSignals` for it, and have the real `intent.parameters` executed under that looser policy's rules — bypassing the capability's own protections entirely, not merely weakening them. `CapabilityPolicyBinder` is unconditionally instantiated inside `RuntimeBuilder.build()` — not configuration, not omittable from production wiring — and runs before both `SignalIntentBinder` and `PolicyEngine.evaluate`, so a wrongly-paired policy is loaded but never evaluated.



Evidence



* packages/policy/src/CapabilityPolicyBinding.ts (`CANONICAL_CAPABILITY_POLICY_BINDINGS`, `CapabilityPolicyBinder`)

* packages/runtime/src/RuntimeBuilder.ts (unconditional construction, no configuration flag)

* packages/runtime/src/RuntimeEngine.ts (binder check ordered before `SignalIntentBinder`/`PolicyEngine.evaluate`)

* packages/policy/tests/unit/CapabilityPolicyBinder.test.ts (proves the exact live-shaped exploit — `razorpay:refund-create` paired with the unrelated, unprotected `customer-refund/1.0.0` policy; `hubspot:deal-update` paired with `vendor-payment` — is rejected; also proves every production-registered capability has a binding)

* docs/architecture/phase3d-independent-authorization-certification.md §5.1 (independent re-verification, Phase 3D)

**Update (code-only ground-truth capture pass, follow-up closure):** this section's "covering every capability the production connector registry actually registers" was, until this pass, not quite true — `CANONICAL_CAPABILITY_POLICY_BINDINGS` also carried a stale `payments:execute` entry left behind by G-27's vendor-payment removal (`docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-27's own update). Removed; the table now matches the claim exactly. See that G-27 update for the full trace.



---



## 2.23 Independently Certified Authorization (Phase 3D)



*"Even if AI has valid credentials, it still cannot execute anything your business hasn't authorized. No exceptions"* — the specific claim tracked and re-verified across `docs/architecture/phase2k-capability-policy-binding.md`, `phase2l-authorization-exceptions.md` (which found it **not fully supported**, naming two exceptions: Razorpay's caller-declared daily cumulative total, and HubSpot's caller-declared `preAuthorizedForAmountChange`) — was independently re-certified from current repository state in `docs/architecture/phase3d-independent-authorization-certification.md`, treating every prior phase's conclusion as a claim to re-verify, not inherit.



**Result: CLAIM FULLY CERTIFIED** for both capabilities actually reachable in production (`razorpay:refund-create`, `hubspot:deal-update`). Both of Phase 2L's named exceptions are independently confirmed closed at the mechanism level (2.4/3.4/3.10's own TD-23 updates), credential isolation, structural capability-to-policy binding (2.22, TD-22), replay resistance, concurrency safety, and auditability were each independently re-traced from source, and no repository evidence was found that materially contradicts the claim for either in-scope capability.



Two narrow, genuinely fixable gaps the certification disclosed were closed in the same follow-up session, not merely noted: a truncated-credential-fragment leak into the caller-visible response (3.4/3.10's `keyIdRedacted`/`bearerRedacted` now return a one-way SHA-256 fingerprint, never a literal credential substring — see 3.4/3.10's own updates below) and a missing live-database concurrency proof for the Razorpay daily-refund-cap ledger (`packages/storage/tests/integration/supabase-razorpay-daily-refund-ledger.integration.test.ts`, new). **`payments:execute`/vendor-payment, originally carried forward here as a sixth disclosed limitation (a capability that would have failed this claim entirely if ever made production-reachable), was removed from the repository outright** rather than independently verified — it was never on the roadmap as a real capability; see `docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-27 for the full account, including what was deliberately retained (the policy file and shared test fixtures that use it as generic example data, which carry no execution risk with zero connector able to back them). Five further disclosed limitations remain carried forward explicitly, each with a stated reason it was not force-closed: HubSpot's approval-issuer registry has never yet been exercised against a real operator-provisioned key; the internal Gateway attestation relies on an upstream nonce check rather than its own independent TTL; the internal gateway-session/credential-vault layer is single-process scoped; `OverrideService`'s continued, deliberate unreachability; and hybrid/PQ signing's scope stopping short of execution-authorization/Gateway/connector signing (most decisively for `OverrideService`, where `02-REMAINING.md`'s own standing security guard says not to wire it up). None of the five carried-forward items provide a currently exploitable path to unauthorized execution — full detail, with exact certification section references for each, in `docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md`'s "Gaps closed in the Phase 3D certification session".



Evidence



* docs/architecture/phase3d-independent-authorization-certification.md (full methodology, per-property verification, adversarial assessment, evidence summary)

* packages/connector-sdk/src/connectors/razorpay/RazorpayTypes.ts (`redactRazorpayKeyId`, fingerprint-based)

* packages/connector-hubspot/src/HubSpotTypes.ts (`redactHubSpotToken`, fingerprint-based)

* packages/storage/tests/integration/supabase-razorpay-daily-refund-ledger.integration.test.ts

## 2.24 Authorization Is Caller-Type-Agnostic



The authorization pipeline's outcome depends only on the requested action, the governing policy, and the independently-verified facts bearing on it — never on what kind of system, model, or entity submitted the request. This is the source-code basis for the positioning claim that Parmana protects institutional authority against execution risk from any source (AI agents, humans, applications, automated systems, third-party systems, compromised systems), not only AI: the mechanism does not special-case any of them, including ones it has no name for.



Directly validated, not inferred from the absence of AI-specific code: `BusinessTransactionMapper.fromRequest` (`packages/api/src/mappers/BusinessTransactionMapper.ts:28`) casts the caller-declared `authority` field with no runtime validation against the `AuthorityType` enum (`USER | ROLE | SERVICE | ORGANIZATION`, `packages/shared/src/domain/authority.ts`) — an arbitrary string reaches the runtime unfiltered. `RuntimeEngine`, `PolicyEngine`, `SignalIntentBinder`, and `CapabilityPolicyBinder` contain zero references to `authority` or caller identity anywhere in their source (confirmed by direct grep across all four files). A regression test submits two transactions through the real `POST /execute` route, identical in every field except `authority.authorityType` — one declaring the conventional `"USER"`, the other declaring `"FULLY_AUTONOMOUS_AI_AGENT_NEVER_SEEN_BEFORE"`, a value that is not a member of the enum at all — and asserts byte-identical decisions (`outcome`, `matchedRuleId`, and, for the rejection case, the exact error text) on both the APPROVE and REJECT paths.



Independently confirmed by the Strategic Positioning source-code validation audit (2026-08-09, read-only): the caller-authentication layer (`StaticKeyAuthenticator`, `packages/api/src/auth/StaticKeyAuthenticator.ts`) authenticates by opaque API-key hash comparison only, with no concept of caller category either — the same identity mechanism a human operator, a script, an AI agent, or a third-party integration would all use identically.



**Scope, precisely:** this claim covers the two production-reachable capabilities (`razorpay:refund-create`, `hubspot:deal-update`, per 2.23) and the general-purpose pipeline mechanism itself. It does not claim that a non-AI caller has actually been exercised against a live production deployment — only that the mechanism contains no code path that could distinguish one caller kind from another to begin with.



Evidence



* packages/api/tests/integration/authority-type-agnostic-execution.integration.test.ts (2 cases: identical APPROVE, identical REJECT, across a conventional and a non-enum `authorityType`)

* packages/api/src/mappers/BusinessTransactionMapper.ts (unvalidated `authority` cast)

* packages/shared/src/domain/authority.ts (`AuthorityType` enum)

* packages/api/src/auth/StaticKeyAuthenticator.ts (caller-type-agnostic authentication)

* Repo-wide grep confirming zero `authority`/caller-identity references in RuntimeEngine.ts, PolicyEngine.ts, SignalIntentBinder.ts, CapabilityPolicyBinding.ts

## 2.25 Strategic Positioning — Independently Validated, YES (Pass 4)



*"Only what you authorize should become real"* — the specific invariant underlying the "We Are Not in the AI Race" positioning — was independently, repeatedly source-code-validated across four passes (`docs/architecture/strategic-positioning-validation.md`, the living record). The first three passes reached **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**: the authorization mechanism itself was fully validated for every capability actually reachable in production, but `payments:execute` (vendor-payment) existed in committed code with unverified caller-declared signals, gated only by `NODE_ENV`, not by any authorization-strength property — a capability that would have violated the claim had it ever been enabled as it then existed.



**The fourth pass, run fresh with no reliance on the first three passes' conclusions, upgraded the verdict to SUPPORTED BY IMPLEMENTATION — YES.** The structural change: `payments:execute` was removed from the repository entirely (`docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-27), not gated more tightly. `createConnectorRegistry.ts` now registers exactly three connectors in production wiring — `test-fixture` (a `NODE_ENV=test`-only, unbound, no-production-implication connector introduced solely to keep shared test infrastructure executable), `razorpay`, `hubspot` — and `payments:execute` has no connector to resolve to in any environment, independently re-confirmed by a dedicated regression test asserting this across `test`, `production`, and `development` `NODE_ENV` values. The fourth pass separately, freshly re-scrutinized the replacement test-only connector itself for new bypass risk (rather than assuming it safe by association with the removal) and found none: it is fail-closed by the identical mechanism every other connector in this registry uses, and unbound from `CapabilityPolicyBinding.ts`'s governance entirely.



**Honesty constraint, carried from the fourth pass's own report, not rounded away here:** that pass re-executed only 2 of the 10 negative tests cited across this validation's history fresh (`authority-type-agnostic-execution.integration.test.ts`; `create-connector-registry.test.ts`'s new absence case) — the other 8 were cited from code paths confirmed structurally unchanged by the removal, not individually re-run in that session. Multi-tenant/cross-institution authority isolation and the direct-database-write bypass finding were explicitly left as "unchanged, not re-traced," not re-asserted clean. The YES verdict means the specific invariant is now supported without a known exception for every capability this repository currently exposes — it is not a claim that every adjacent property was re-proven from scratch in the same session. Full precision on this distinction: `docs/architecture/strategic-positioning-validation.md` §6 ("Final Answer").

## 2.26 Policy Governance (Maker-Checker)



Policy content changes now go through a human-only, maker-checker approval flow before taking effect, closing the prior gap that policy authoring was entirely outside Parmana's own governance surface: any caller with write access to `policies/` could change what a policy allows with no second party involved and no durable, signed record of who approved it.



**Lifecycle and the four endpoints.** A change moves `PENDING_APPROVAL` → `APPROVED`/`REJECTED`, exactly once, never back (`packages/shared/src/domain/pending-policy-change.ts`). Four endpoints in `packages/api/src/routes/pending-policy-changes.ts` cover the full flow — `POST /:name/:version/pending-changes` (propose, line 243), `GET /pending-changes` (list with embedded diff, line 381), `POST /pending-changes/:id/approve` (line 459), `POST /pending-changes/:id/reject` (line 553) — and every one of the four calls `requireHumanCaller()` before doing anything else (lines 341, 396, 474, 568). `isHumanCaller()` itself (`packages/api/src/auth/isHumanCaller.ts`) is unit-tested directly (`packages/api/tests/unit/isHumanCaller.test.ts`, 3 cases: USER accepted, undefined credentialHolderType fails closed, ROLE/SERVICE/ORGANIZATION all denied the same as unset), and each endpoint is separately exercised at the HTTP level in `packages/api/tests/integration/pending-policy-changes-governance.integration.test.ts` (non-human denial on propose, list, approve, and reject).



**Maker ≠ checker.** `SameActorCannotApproveOwnChangeError` is thrown independently on both approve (`pending-policy-changes.ts:492`) and reject (`:598`) when `proposedBy === req.callerId`, verified by `"rejects the maker approving its own change with 403 SAME_ACTOR_CANNOT_APPROVE_OWN_CHANGE"` and `"rejects the maker rejecting its own change with 403 SAME_ACTOR_CANNOT_APPROVE_OWN_CHANGE"` in the same integration suite.



**Step-up authorization (Layer 4).** Approve/reject additionally require a `PolicyChangeStepUpAuthorization` envelope (`packages/shared/src/domain/policy-change-step-up-authorization.ts`) signed by the checker's own key, on top of — never instead of — their bearer token. `PolicyChangeStepUpVerifier` (`packages/api/src/auth/PolicyChangeStepUpVerifier.ts`) reuses `@parmana/envelope-verifier`'s `NonceStore` interface with a dedicated instance/table (`createPolicyChangeStepUpNonceStore.ts`, `SupabasePolicyChangeStepUpNonceStore`) so step-up replay protection never shares a namespace with execution-authorization or approval-artifact nonces. The integration suite proves a missing envelope, an expired one, and a replayed one are each independently rejected, alongside wrong-id/wrong-action/wrong-key cases. Per-check diagnostic detail is logged server-side only (`console.error`, never in the HTTP response) — an earlier draft of this endpoint leaked that detail into the 403 body; caught and fixed before merge, not shipped.



**File write and signing, in the safer order.** `PolicyChangeApprovalService.approve()` (`packages/api/src/governance/PolicyChangeApprovalService.ts`) signs and durably persists the `PolicyChangeApprovalRecord` *before* writing the live `policies/{name}/{version}/policy.json` file (`policyChangeApprovalRecordRepository.create()` at line 113, `policyRepository.save()` at line 115) — not merely documented as the intent but proven: `packages/api/tests/unit/PolicyChangeApprovalService.test.ts` injects a failure at each step independently and confirms (1) when the file write fails, the signed record still exists and independently verifies, and (2) when persisting the record fails, the file write is never attempted at all. The whole service runs before `PendingPolicyChangeRepository.resolve()`, so a failure anywhere in it leaves the pending change untouched rather than falsely marked `APPROVED`.



**Content hash at decision time (G-24).** Separately from the governance write path, `RuntimeEngine.execute()` now stamps `ExecutionTrustRecord.transaction.policy.contentHash` with a hash of the policy document actually loaded for that decision (`packages/runtime/src/RuntimeEngine.ts`, computed at line 204 via the same `TrustRecordHasher` every other artifact hash in this codebase uses, merged into the trust-record-bound copy only — never into the caller-submitted `BusinessTransaction`, which is already persisted, contentHash-free, before this point). `packages/runtime/tests/e2e/runtime.e2e.test.ts`'s `"stamps transaction.policy.contentHash on the Execution Trust Record with a hash of the real loaded policy content (G-24, policy-governance milestone)"` proves the stamped value equals an independently-computed hash of the real on-disk `vendor-payment/2.0.0` policy, and differs when the content differs.



**Deploy/startup integrity check.** `verifyPolicyGovernanceIntegrityAtStartup()` (`packages/api/src/governance/verifyPolicyGovernanceIntegrityAtStartup.ts`) compares every approved `(policyName, policyVersion)`'s live file against `PolicyChangeApprovalRecordRepository.findMostRecentFor(...).contentHashAfter`, catching a file edited outside the pending-change API. It is fired from `server.ts` (line 89) *after* `app.listen()` (line 74) without being awaited, and is deliberately fail-open — the opposite discipline of `assertStorageConfigured`/`assertSigningKeyMaterialConfigured` earlier in the same file. Four distinct log events keep outcomes from blurring together: `policy_governance_integrity_check_unavailable` ("couldn't check"), `policy_governance_integrity_mismatch` ("checked, found a problem"), and `policy_governance_integrity_check_passed` ("checked, clean"). A re-approved version is checked exactly once, against the most recent record, and one bad pair never blocks the check for the rest — all proven by `packages/api/tests/unit/verifyPolicyGovernanceIntegrityAtStartup.test.ts`'s 7 cases.



**`governance-ui`: a read-only internal tool, by design.** `packages/governance-ui` is a small standalone Express package (server-rendered templates, no client-side JS or build step) covering propose/list/diff-review only. It has exactly five routes — `GET`/`POST /login`, `POST /logout`, `GET /` (list), `GET /pending-changes/:id` (diff) — and no route, form, or template anywhere targets `/approve` or `/reject`; the diff page's instructions tell a checker to run `scripts/sign-policy-change-step-up.ts` locally and submit the result themselves, with their own bearer token, outside this UI entirely. A submitted API key is validated once against `GET /callers/me`, then held only in an in-memory, server-side `express-session` — it is attached as the outbound `Authorization` header on every call this UI makes to `packages/api` and never appears in any rendered response; a live check against a real running API confirmed the raw key string is absent from every page this session produced. `packages/governance-ui/tests/integration/app.integration.test.ts`'s `"escapes attacker-controlled content (reason, proposer) rather than rendering it raw"` proves a maker-supplied `reason`/`proposedBy` containing a `<script>` tag renders escaped, not executable, in the checker's browser.



**Deliberate scope boundaries, not gaps.** Two things are intentionally not built: `@parmana/sdk` does not yet expose these four endpoints — `governance-ui` calls `packages/api` directly over plain `fetch`, and adding SDK methods is deferred until a second real consumer exists beyond this UI, not an oversight. And approve/reject remain CLI-only by design: `governance-ui` never handles step-up private key material, since the entire security guarantee of step-up authorization rests on that key never leaving the checker's own machine — a web UI collecting it would defeat the property the mechanism exists to provide.



**Independently audited, separately from the build.** A follow-up audit re-verified every claim above from source rather than trusting the build session's own summary: re-running the full test suite fresh, tracing the approve flow's actual code order end to end, independently re-computing the content-hash-at-decision-time value from scratch (a hand-rolled canonicalization and sha256 implementation, not the codebase's own hasher) against a live execution, and grepping for any private-key material or alternate bypass path. It found two real, narrow defects — both fixed and covered by a new regression test: a single stray NUL byte in `verifyPolicyGovernanceIntegrityAtStartup.ts` (cosmetic — it made the file render as a binary diff in git, not a functional bug) and a real gap in the fail-open guarantee, where `runPolicyGovernanceIntegrityCheckAtStartup.ts` constructed `PolicyChangeCrypto` synchronously, outside the promise `.catch()` meant to guard it, so a future constructor failure could have propagated and crashed the process after the port was already bound. `packages/api/tests/unit/runPolicyGovernanceIntegrityCheckAtStartup.test.ts` proves the fix: confirmed failing against the pre-fix code, then confirmed passing against the fix.



**Deployment status.** This claim is about what exists in the repository and is proven correct by the tests cited above, not about what is currently running in any live environment. The backend (maker-checker endpoints, step-up auth, sign-then-write ordering, content-hash-at-decision-time, the startup integrity check) is committed and pushed to `origin/main`. Whether `parmana-api.fly.dev` / `parmana-api-live.fly.dev` are running this code has not been checked as part of this claim and is not asserted here.



**Open question: internal vs. external policy authoring.** The system described above resolves *how* a policy change is approved once Parmana is the system of record for that approval. It does not resolve *whether* Parmana should be the system of record at all: an alternative architecture — policies authored and approved in an external system, with Parmana staying strictly read-only/enforcement-only for policy content (loading and evaluating whatever content it is handed, verifying its provenance, never hosting the approval workflow itself) — remains a live, undecided option. Nothing in the codebase picks a side; the maker-checker system exists because policy authoring was previously outside any governance surface at all (this section's opening claim), not because "build it internally" was compared against and preferred over the external alternative. Treat this as an open question, not a resolved default.



**Open question: the human-vs-AI-agent identity problem.** `isHumanCaller()` (`packages/api/src/auth/isHumanCaller.ts`) checks `credentialHolderType === AuthorityType.USER` — a value set once, at credential-issuance time, by whoever provisions the credential. Nothing in this codebase, or in any bearer-token/asymmetric-key scheme generally, technically verifies that the entity that generated the key material and holds the private key is a human rather than an automated system with access to the provisioning step. This is a known, general limitation of software-based identity, not a Parmana-specific gap, and not one a purely technical fix within this codebase can close: a credential's `USER` flag is exactly as trustworthy as the process that set it, never more. The current mitigation is operational, not code-enforced: the standing rule is that key generation and step-up signing for a checker's credential must happen on a device with no AI agent access, so that whatever holds the resulting private key is, by the constraints of that device, a human acting directly. No code path in `PolicyChangeStepUpVerifier`, `isHumanCaller`, or anywhere else in this feature checks or enforces that rule — it is a process control sitting outside the system, the same category as "don't commit your private key," not a guarantee this repository's tests can prove.



**Legacy-policy backfill: current state and exact pause point.** Confirmed by direct query against the live `pending_policy_changes` and `policy_change_approval_records` tables (2026-08-19): all 10 pre-existing policies — `access-control`, `connector-capability`, `customer-refund`, `database-change`, `github-pr-approval`, `hubspot-deal-update`, `llm-tool-call`, `production-deployment`, `rag-document-access`, `vendor-payment` — were proposed through the real `POST /:name/:version/pending-changes` endpoint on 2026-08-19 between 01:47:43 and 01:47:47 UTC, each proposed by the same caller (`charak1987`). Zero rows exist in `policy_change_approval_records` — no policy, legacy or otherwise, has ever completed the approval flow. This is exactly the state maker≠checker is designed to produce and enforce: `SameActorCannotApproveOwnChangeError` (above) means the proposer cannot approve their own ten proposals, and per the operating rule above, whoever does approve them must generate and use their step-up signing key on a separate device with no AI agent access — the same discipline that governs every other checker action under this feature, applied without exception to the backfill. Work is paused precisely at "awaiting a second, genuinely distinct human checker's availability to perform that approval on a disconnected device" — nothing else; there is no unresolved technical or code issue blocking it. All ten pending changes remain safely `PENDING_APPROVAL`: `pending_policy_changes` has no expiry mechanism (`packages/shared/src/domain/pending-policy-change.ts`), the database-level partial unique index (`ux_pending_policy_changes_open`, `supabase/migrations/20260818120000_add_policy_governance_tables.sql`) prevents a second, conflicting proposal for the same `(policy_name, policy_version)` while one is open, and none of the ten live policy files have been touched, so the pause creates no window of unenforced or inconsistent policy content.

# 3. Conditional Claims



The following claims are true only under an explicitly stated scope. The scope clause is load-bearing: removing it makes the claim false.



---



## 3.1 Non-Bypassable Envelope Verification (Scoped)



For any system running the Parmana envelope verifier, execution requests not authorized by Parmana are cryptographically impossible to accept.



This claim holds only for a receiving system that (a) runs @parmana/envelope-verifier and (b) gates every execution-triggering code path behind its verification result. Parmana enforces nothing at the network level. A receiving system that does not call the verifier, or that calls it but does not act on a failing result, is not covered by this claim.



Evidence



* @parmana/envelope-verifier (EnvelopeVerifier.verify, requireParmanaAuthorization)



---



## 3.2 Fleet-Wide Single-Use Requires a Shared NonceStore



Single-use enforcement of an authorization's nonce is scoped to whichever NonceStore instance performs the check. If multiple independent receiving systems, or multiple instances of the same system, each use their own NonceStore, the same authorization can be accepted once per instance. Fleet-wide single-use requires every instance to share one persistent NonceStore that survives a process restart, not a per-process, in-memory one.



Parmana's own production gateway does this by default. `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createNonceStore.ts` wires in `SupabaseNonceStore` (`packages/storage/src/supabase/SupabaseNonceStore.ts`), a durable, Postgres-backed NonceStore shared across every process pointed at the same Supabase project, and fails closed at startup if it is not configured, rather than silently falling back to a per-process `MemoryNonceStore`. A receiving system that does not share a persistent NonceStore (whether by choice, misconfiguration, or because it is not Parmana's own gateway) still has its exposure window bounded by the envelope's short TTL, not unlimited. This is the general, deployment-agnostic version of the claim, and still the correct one for any `@parmana/envelope-verifier` integrator supplying their own NonceStore choice; `MemoryNonceStore` remains available and correct for tests.



Evidence



* NonceStore / MemoryNonceStore / SupabaseNonceStore

* packages/api/src/bootstrap/createNonceStore.ts (production wiring; fails closed when Supabase is not configured, never falls back to in-memory)

* packages/storage/tests/integration/supabase-nonce-store.integration.test.ts: "a nonce consumed through one store instance is still consumed by a fresh instance against the same backing" (the fleet-sharing / restart-survival proof) and "two simultaneous checkAndRecord calls for the same nonce: exactly one succeeds" (a real concurrent-INSERT race against Postgres, not a simulated one)

* packages/envelope-verifier/README.md ("Claims", "PRODUCTION WARNING: MemoryNonceStore")



---



## 3.3 Connector SDK Foundation (Scoped)



@parmana/connector-sdk defines a Connector authoring contract (Connector, ConnectorRequest, ConnectorResponse, ConnectorExecutionContext, ConnectorCapability, ConnectorMetadata, ConnectorVersion, ConnectorHealth, ConnectorFactory) and extends execution-control's ConnectorRegistry, CredentialVault, and ConnectorPolicy seams without modifying them. This claim covers only the foundation: two reference connectors (HttpConnector, MockConnector), a credential-provider seam (StaticCredentialProvider, EnvironmentCredentialProvider), and deterministic connector evidence attached to the existing Execution Trust Record via the existing, unmodified ExecutionEvidence.attributes path and the existing TrustRecordHasher. It does not claim any enterprise-specific connector, any cloud secret-manager integration, or any change to Phase 1's Runtime, Policy Engine, Execution Gateway, Replay, Receipt Generation, Verification, or REST API; all of which remain exactly as evidenced elsewhere in this document.



Evidence



* packages/connector-sdk/src (Connector, ConnectorRegistry, CredentialProvider, SdkConnectorExecutor, HttpConnector, MockConnector, CapabilityConnectorPolicy)

* packages/connector-sdk/tests/unit (45 tests: registry, credential-provider leak checks, HttpConnector incl. timeout/fail-closed, MockConnector, evidence hashing/redaction, end-to-end Gateway integration, Execution Trust Record hash-boundary regression)

* policies/connector-capability/1.0.0/policy.json (reference policy: ALLOW crm:read, BLOCK crm:delete, threshold-gated payments:refund, default BLOCK, no approval-workflow outcome)

## 3.8 Deployed Environment: Full Chain via a Permanent Public Endpoint (Scoped) — Historical: Razorpay connector removed 2026-08-12

**This claim was true and independently verifiable when written (2026-07-19, commit `7d27e63`).** The Razorpay connector it documents was deliberately removed from this codebase on 2026-08-12 (see the removal commit). This section is retained as the permanent historical record of what was demonstrated — it is not a claim about current capability, and nothing below should be read as describing present-tense behavior. Parmana does not run a Razorpay connector today. The dated, external record of this proof is `docs/site/trust-and-claims/trl7-verification.mdx` (2026-08-01 verification session) and `docs/site/changelog.mdx`.

Closes the last gap 3.7 (now removed; see this claim's own history in `docs/site/changelog.mdx`) left open: a real Razorpay-initiated webhook delivery had previously been proven only against a temporary `cloudflared` tunnel run locally, with no standing infrastructure. This claim proved the identical full chain — a real refund, a real Razorpay-initiated webhook, signature-verified, correlated, and closed into a signed Settlement Confirmation — against Parmana's actual deployed instance, reachable at a permanent public URL, continuously running, not a one-time local exercise.



**Deployment**: `parmana-api`, a single Docker image (see DEPLOYMENT.md), running on Fly.io across two machines in the `lhr` region (`fly.toml` declares `primary_region = 'bom'`; the actually running machines are `lhr` — this claim states the observed region, not the configured one). Durable storage (`PARMANA_STORAGE=supabase`) and the webhook/settlement event stores are Supabase-backed, shared across both machines. The API requires caller authentication at every route except `/health`, `/ready`, `/openapi.yaml`, `/documentation`, `POST /refusal/verify`, and `POST /audit/verify` (2.16): an unauthenticated `POST /execute` was observed returning `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="Parmana"`, never falling open.



`POST /webhooks/razorpay` is registered permanently — not through a tunnel — at `https://parmana-api.fly.dev/webhooks/razorpay`, in the Razorpay Dashboard's Test Mode, for `refund.processed` and `refund.failed`.



**Procedure**: one authenticated, gated 100-paise refund was created through the full production `POST /execute` chain against the same manually captured test-mode payment 3.4/3.7 use, executed against the deployed instance. Razorpay created the refund (id redacted `rfnd_**********T9Cj`) and, independently, delivered a genuine `refund.processed` webhook to the permanent endpoint above. The deployed instance's webhook route verified its signature against the rotated `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, persisted the event, and the deployed settlement poll loop (`scripts/process-razorpay-settlements.ts`, `pollIntervalMs: 15000`) drained it: fetch-verified the refund's real status directly from Razorpay, and appended a signed `SETTLED` Settlement Confirmation (`confirmationId dcb06247-6e7a-4adf-b709-5da407f0b054`, `fetchedRefundStatus: "processed"`) to the Execution Trust Record, surfaced correctly on `GET /verification/{businessTransactionId}`. Elapsed time from `POST /execute` to the signed `SETTLED` confirmation: approximately 48 seconds.



Correlation is proven by construction, not just observation: `RazorpaySettlementProcessor` never queries Razorpay for refunds on its own — `runOnce()` only drains events already sitting in the durable webhook event store, and the only code path that ever writes to that store is the webhook route, only after signature verification succeeds. Since the business transaction id driving this refund was freshly generated for this exercise, a matching event could only have entered the store via a genuinely delivered, correctly signed webhook POST from Razorpay to the permanent endpoint above.



This claim is scoped narrowly: one real delivery, test mode only, against a permanent endpoint. It does not claim live-mode operation, load-bearing traffic, or high availability — the deployment runs two machines for redundancy, not for capacity or failover behavior that has been tested. [FUTURE] live-mode operation remains open (see 3.4/Future Claims).



Evidence



* `fly.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `docker/entrypoint.sh` (deployment shape)



* `packages/api/src/routes/ready.ts` (readiness probe distinguishing Supabase-backed storage from in-memory)



* `packages/api/src/middleware/caller-auth.ts` (401 + `WWW-Authenticate` on missing credential, observed live against the deployed instance)



* `scripts/process-razorpay-settlements.ts` (the deployed settlement poll loop; `RAZORPAY_SETTLEMENT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`)



* Live smoke test performed against `https://parmana-api.fly.dev` this session: unauthenticated `POST /execute` → `401`; one authenticated 100-paise refund via `POST /execute`; `GET /verification/{businessTransactionId}` polled until `settlement.status: "SETTLED"` (confirmationId `dcb06247-6e7a-4adf-b709-5da407f0b054`, `fetchedRefundStatus: "processed"`, refund id redacted `rfnd_**********T9Cj`)

## 3.9 Deployed Environment: Live-Mode Full Chain (Scoped) — Historical: Razorpay connector removed 2026-08-12

**This claim was true and independently verifiable when written (2026-07-20, commit `57558d6`).** The Razorpay connector it documents was deliberately removed from this codebase on 2026-08-12. Retained as historical record only — not a current-capability claim. See `docs/site/trust-and-claims/trl7-verification.mdx` and `docs/site/changelog.mdx` for the permanent dated record.

Closes the gap 3.8 (and the now-removed 3.4) left open: every live claim before this one was against Razorpay's test-mode API only. This claim proved the identical full chain — a real refund, a real Razorpay-initiated webhook, signature-verified, correlated, and closed into a signed Settlement Confirmation — in Razorpay **Live Mode**, against a second, separately deployed instance.



**Deployment**: `parmana-api-live`, the same Docker image (see DEPLOYMENT.md), running on Fly.io in the `sin` region (`fly.live.toml` declares `primary_region = 'sin'`; the actually running machines are also `sin` — no region mismatch this time, unlike 3.8's `parmana-api`). Durable storage (`PARMANA_STORAGE=supabase`) and the webhook/settlement event stores are Supabase-backed, shared across both machines. `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` are a live-mode (`rzp_live_`) key pair, distinct from every other credential used elsewhere in this document. Caller authentication is enforced identically to 3.8: an unauthenticated `POST /execute` was observed returning `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="Parmana"` against this deployment specifically.



`POST /webhooks/razorpay` is registered permanently at `https://parmana-api-live.fly.dev/webhooks/razorpay`, in the Razorpay Dashboard's **Live Mode** specifically (not Test Mode — see 3.7/3.8 for the debugging cost of getting this wrong), for `refund.processed` and `refund.failed`.



**Procedure**: a real ₹10.00 Payment Link was created and paid with a real card, live, through Razorpay-hosted checkout. One authenticated, policy-gated 100-paise refund was then created through the full production `POST /execute` chain against that payment (`pay_` id redacted below). Razorpay created the refund (id redacted `rfnd_**********WnNG`) and, independently, delivered a genuine `refund.processed` webhook to the permanent endpoint above. The deployed instance's webhook route verified its signature, persisted the event, and the deployed settlement poll loop drained it: fetch-verified the refund's real status directly from Razorpay, and appended a signed `SETTLED` Settlement Confirmation (`confirmationId 6a334df8-190d-4835-9050-b54e6657e05f`, `fetchedRefundStatus: "processed"`), surfaced correctly on `GET /verification/{businessTransactionId}`. Elapsed time from `POST /execute` to the signed `SETTLED` confirmation: approximately 43 seconds.



Correlation is proven by construction, for the same reason 3.8 states: the settlement processor never queries Razorpay on its own initiative — `runOnce()` only drains events already sitting in the durable webhook event store, and the only writer to that store is the webhook route, only after signature verification succeeds. The `businessTransactionId` driving this refund was freshly generated for this exercise, so a matching event could only have entered the store via a genuinely delivered, correctly signed Live Mode webhook POST from Razorpay.



This claim is scoped narrowly and deliberately: **one** real-money refund (₹1.00 / 100 paise), one deployed instance, one live-mode webhook delivery. It does not claim volume, sustained load, high availability, or tested failover behavior — `parmana-api-live` runs the same two-machine shape as `parmana-api` for redundancy, not capacity or failover that has been exercised. It does not claim Razorpay payout creation (RazorpayX remains a distinct, unimplemented item — see Future Claims), and it does not claim any change to Phase 1's Runtime, Policy Engine, Execution Gateway, Replay, Receipt Generation, Verification, or REST API.



Evidence



* `fly.live.toml` (app `parmana-api-live`, `primary_region = 'sin'`)



* `packages/api/src/middleware/caller-auth.ts` (401 + `WWW-Authenticate` on missing credential, observed live against this deployment)

## 3.10 HubSpot Deal Stage/Amount Update Connector (Scoped)

`@parmana/connector-hubspot` is a new, standalone workspace package (not a subdirectory of `@parmana/connector-sdk`, unlike Salesforce/SAP/Oracle/Workday/Razorpay) that depends on `@parmana/connector-sdk`'s `Connector` authoring contract the same way those connectors do. It authorizes exactly one HubSpot CRM Objects API action this milestone: updating a Deal's `dealstage` property, optionally alongside `amount` in the same `PATCH /crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}` call. This claim covers dealstage/amount update on Deals only. Contacts, Companies, deleting or archiving deals, any HubSpot webhook/event-driven trigger, and multi-object transactions are all explicitly out of scope this milestone (see Future Claims).

`HubSpotConnector`, as originally shipped (`packages/connector-hubspot/src/HubSpotConnector.ts`; see the Phase 1C update below for where this logic lives today), is deny-by-default at the property level, not just the object-type level: a `hubspot:deal-update` request naming any property other than `dealstage`/`amount` is refused before any network call, rather than silently dropped — silently dropping an unsupported property could mask a caller's real intent behind an update that quietly did less than requested. `HUBSPOT_ALLOWED_DEAL_UPDATE_PROPERTIES` (`HubSpotTypes.ts`) is the single source of truth both the connector's guard and its PATCH-body construction read from.

Learning directly from this codebase's own Razorpay incidents, both fixes are structural in this connector's first version rather than retrofitted after the fact:

* **Placeholder-credential guard, from day one.** `RazorpayConnector` originally had no guard against sending its built-in test-mode placeholder credential to Razorpay's real production API — it survived only because Razorpay happened to reject an unrecognized key, an accident of Razorpay's behavior, not a guarantee this codebase controlled (see 3.4's "defense-in-depth fix" paragraph, added only after the gap was noticed). `HubSpotConnector` refuses, before any network call, to send `HUBSPOT_TEST_MODE_PLACEHOLDER_TOKEN` to HubSpot's real API (`https://api.hubapi.com`) unless `baseUrl` is explicitly overridden to a mock server — the same shape of guard, present from this connector's very first version, not added after an incident.

**Update (execution-ownership refactor, Phase 1C):** `HubSpotConnector`'s executable class -- including the property allowlist guard and the placeholder-credential guard both described above -- was migrated verbatim to `GatewayHubSpotAdapter` (`packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/GatewayHubSpotAdapter.ts`), mirroring 3.4's identical Razorpay migration exactly (same commit, same "migrated verbatim... only the executable class moved" pattern). `HubSpotDealUpdateService` and `HubSpotDealUpdateHarness` no longer exist anywhere in the repository; capability identifiers and DTOs (`HubSpotCapabilities.ts`, `HubSpotTypes.ts`) stayed in `@parmana/connector-hubspot` and are imported into the adapter. `MockHubSpotServer.ts` is unchanged at its original path.
* **No bridge variable, from day one.** `createRazorpayCredentialProvider.ts`'s `NODE_ENV=test` branch originally read a word-order-swapped bridge variable (`TEST_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`SECRET` instead of the documented `RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_ID`/`SECRET`), fixed only after the fact (this document's own "fix: distinguish policy denial..." and credential-provider commits). `createHubSpotCredentialProvider.ts` reads `TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` directly — the exact name documented in `.env.example` — with no intermediate variable to drift out of sync. Production reads `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN`; if unset outside test mode, `createHubSpotCredentialProvider()` returns `undefined` and `createConnectorRegistry.ts` does not register the HubSpot connector at all, so `hubspot:deal-fetch`/`hubspot:deal-update` simply have no connector to resolve to (`ConnectorSdkRegistry`'s existing "No connector registered for capability" fail-closed error) — the same fail-closed absence behavior as `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`SECRET`, not a startup crash or a fallback to mock credentials.

`MockHubSpotServer` (`packages/connector-hubspot/src/MockHubSpotServer.ts`) is a hermetic, in-memory stand-in for the Deals subset of the CRM Objects API (`GET`/`PATCH /crm/v3/objects/deals/:id`) used by every default test run; it never makes or receives real network traffic beyond localhost.

**Policy** (`policies/hubspot-deal-update/1.0.0/policy.json`, evaluated by the same unmodified `PolicyEngine`): a proposed `dealstage` transition is checked against `isHubSpotStageTransitionAllowed` (`HubSpotDealUpdateSignals.ts`) — forward-only through a fixed default stage order (`HUBSPOT_DEFAULT_STAGE_ORDER`), plus a fixed allowance to move to `closedlost` from any non-terminal stage; any transition out of a terminal stage (`closedwon`/`closedlost`), any backward move, and any move to or from a stage id not in the configured order are all denied. An `amount` change whose absolute delta from the deal's current amount exceeds `HUBSPOT_DEFAULT_AMOUNT_CHANGE_THRESHOLD` (10,000, in the deal's own currency units) is denied unless the caller declares `preAuthorizedForAmountChange: true`. `boundSignals` (`proposedDealStage` → `parameters.dealstage`, `proposedAmount` → `parameters.amount`) is present from this policy's first version — the same `SignalIntentBinder` hardening 3.4 added to `razorpay-refund/1.0.0/policy.json` only after a live demonstration of the amount-mismatch vector (see 3.4's "adversarial-testing hardening session" update) is applied here proactively, before any equivalent gap could be demonstrated.

**Two open decisions this milestone deliberately does not resolve, flagged here rather than silently picked:**

1. **Per-pipeline vs. global stage-transition rules.** `HUBSPOT_DEFAULT_STAGE_ORDER` is one global, hardcoded stage order, not configured per-pipeline. A HubSpot account with multiple pipelines (each with its own stage ids and ordering) is not represented — a `proposedDealStage` that happens to share a stage id with this default order is evaluated against it regardless of which pipeline the deal actually belongs to, and a deal in a genuinely different pipeline with differently-ordered or differently-named stages is not correctly modeled at all. `isHubSpotStageTransitionAllowed` accepts a `stageOrder` parameter and `buildHubSpotDealUpdateSignals`/`HubSpotDealUpdateService` thread it through, so per-pipeline configuration is a real, already-seamed extension point — it is just not wired up to anything pipeline-aware this milestone.
2. **One authorization check vs. two.** `dealstage` and `amount` are evaluated by a single policy pack under a single capability (`hubspot:deal-update`) and a single signed authorization, whether the request changes one property or both — not two independently revocable authorization scopes. This mirrors HubSpot's own API shape (`PATCH` already accepts both properties in one call) and keeps this milestone's authorization surface no larger than the underlying HTTP action, but it means an operator cannot grant "amount changes only" without also granting "dealstage changes," or vice versa, without introducing a second capability. Splitting into `hubspot:deal-update-stage` / `hubspot:deal-update-amount` (each independently authorizable, each requiring its own signed authorization even when a caller wants to change both in what HubSpot would still execute as one PATCH) remains unresolved future work.

A third, narrower point this milestone originally left unresolved: `preAuthorizedForAmountChange` was, at the time, a caller-declared boolean signal with no independent verification. Absent, it defaults to `false` — the safe default: an over-threshold amount change is denied unless a caller declares it pre-authorized.

**Update (TD-23, Phase 3C, now closed):** `preAuthorizedForAmountChange` is no longer trusted verbatim. `HubSpotSignalStateVerifier` (`packages/connector-hubspot/src/HubSpotSignalStateVerifier.ts`), constructed with a real `ApprovalVerifier` (`@parmana/approval`) unconditionally in `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createHubSpotSignalStateVerifier.ts` (that file's own comment: "approvalVerifier is always supplied here (never omitted) -- the production wiring path is where independent verification... becomes a structural invariant rather than an optional, caller-declared signal"), verifies a caller's `preAuthorizedForAmountChange: true` claim against a real, independently-issued, Ed25519-signed Approval Artifact (`SignedApproval`, `docs/architecture/phase3a-authorization-artifact-design.md`) carried in `signals.approvalArtifact` -- checking issuer identity against a registry, signature validity, expiry, capability/resource scope match, and single-use nonce consumption (`ApprovalVerifier.verify`, `packages/approval/src/ApprovalVerifier.ts`), all before the declared value is trusted. A missing, expired, wrong-scope, replayed, or unsigned artifact is treated as `preAuthorizedForAmountChange: false` regardless of what the caller declared. This closes the gap `docs/architecture/phase2l-authorization-exceptions.md` independently re-confirmed still open as of that phase.

**Operational scope, independently confirmed by Phase 3D:** `createApprovalIssuerRegistry.ts`'s `TRUSTED_APPROVAL_ISSUERS` list ships **empty by default** — no real business-approver key is provisioned in this deployment. This is the correct fail-closed starting state (every `preAuthorizedForAmountChange` claim is rejected, genuine artifact or not, until an operator adds a real entry and deploys), not a gap in the mechanism above, but it means no over-threshold `hubspot:deal-update` amount change can be legitimately approved in the current deployment as configured — only ever denied. The verification mechanism itself is proven correct by unit and integration test against synthetic issuers (below); it has not yet been exercised against a real, operator-provisioned issuer key in production. See `docs/architecture/phase3d-independent-authorization-certification.md` §4.2, §12.3.

**Test posture, in the order specified for this milestone:**

* **Hermetic first, as originally shipped.** `packages/connector-hubspot/tests/unit/` (42 tests, all passing, no network calls beyond localhost): `hubspot-connector.test.ts` (12 — fetch, dealstage-only update, combined dealstage+amount update, deny-by-default property guard before any network call, empty-update rejection, non-2xx/timeout fail-closed, bad-credential-shape rejection, token never leaked into a thrown error or response metadata, placeholder-credential guard against the real endpoint and its mock-server exemption); `hubspot-deal-update-policy.test.ts` (9 — schema validation and every rule branch, including that no rule ever produces `require_override`); `hubspot-deal-update-signals.test.ts` (12 — `isHubSpotStageTransitionAllowed`'s forward/backward/terminal/unrecognized-stage cases, `buildHubSpotDealUpdateSignals`'s delta/threshold arithmetic and boundSignals-safe omission of absent fields); `hubspot-deal-update-harness.test.ts` (9 — the full authorize → verify → execute → confirm chain against `MockHubSpotServer` for approved dealstage-only, combined, and pre-authorized-over-threshold-amount cases; policy replay with no second HTTP call; token isolation from the receipt; `businessTransactionHash` tamper rejection). **Current location, after the Phase 1C migration and TD-23 (see updates above):** `hubspot-connector.test.ts` moved to `packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/` (12 tests, unchanged); `hubspot-deal-update-harness.test.ts` no longer exists (`HubSpotDealUpdateHarness` was deleted, not migrated); a new `HubSpotSignalStateVerifier.test.ts` (10 tests) covers the TD-23 Approval Artifact verification instead. Current total: 43 unit tests across the two packages, all passing.
* **Policy-denial-makes-zero-calls.** Proven at two layers. At the connector-execution layer (`packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/hubspot-connector.test.ts`, following the Phase 1C migration above), a denied stage transition or over-threshold amount change makes zero `PATCH` calls, asserted by reading the deal directly off `MockHubSpotServer` afterward and confirming it is byte-for-byte unchanged — the same assertion style Razorpay's own policy-denial cases use. At the HTTP boundary (`packages/api/tests/integration/hubspot-deal-update.integration.test.ts`, 3 tests, all passing), a policy `REJECTED` decision reached through the real, production-wired `POST /execute` — the same generic caller-supplied-signals mechanism `razorpay-refund.integration.test.ts`'s own denial test exercises — is caught in `ExecutionGate.enforce` before `ExecutionComponent` ever dispatches to the connector: `response.status === 403`, `response.body.code === "POLICY_DENIED"`, and (strengthening beyond Razorpay's own precedent, which only checks the mock server's resulting state) a `fetch` spy asserting literally zero calls reached the mock server's base URL at all, for both a disallowed stage transition and an over-threshold amount change.
* **Gated live suite second — now run live, not merely confirmed to skip.** `packages/api/tests/integration/hubspot-live.integration.test.ts` (3 tests), gated behind `ALLOW_LIVE_HUBSPOT=1` + `TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` (must start with `pat-`, checked before any network call — mirroring `RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_ID`'s `rzp_test_` check) + `TEST_HUBSPOT_DEAL_ID` for the third, mutating case, skipped by default so this stays opt-in rather than default `npm test` behavior. An earlier session confirmed only that the suite skips cleanly with no credentials configured; this session ran it live, to completion, against a real HubSpot developer/test account, all **3/3 passing**:

  1. `hubspot:deal-fetch` against a deliberately non-existent deal id (`999999999999`), driven through the full production `POST /execute` chain, reached a real, distinguishable `4xx` HTTP response from `api.hubapi.com` — a genuine round trip, not a network failure (reachability only, mirroring `razorpay-live.integration.test.ts`'s non-existent-payment-id cases). One real call observed against `https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/deals/999999999999...`, status ≥ 400.
  2. A policy denial (disallowed dealstage transition, `closedlost` → `qualifiedtobuy`) through the same `POST /execute` path returned `403`/`POLICY_DENIED`, and a `fetch` spy confirmed literally zero calls reached `api.hubapi.com` for the denial — `ExecutionGate.enforce` rejects before `ExecutionComponent` ever dispatches to the connector.
  3. Against the real test deal (`TEST_HUBSPOT_DEAL_ID`, redacted `********0850`): the deal's live `amount` was read via `hubspot:deal-fetch`, nudged by a fixed, small, within-threshold delta of 1 (currency unit) through `hubspot:deal-update` via `POST /execute`, confirmed changed by an independent live `GET` (a test-side oracle bypassing the connector, mirroring `razorpay-live.integration.test.ts`'s `fetchRefundsLive`), then reverted to its original value through a second `POST /execute` call and confirmed reverted by the same independent oracle. The exact real amount value is deliberately not recorded here (this document is not the place to disclose a real CRM record's business data); the assertion that matters — original value read, changed, then restored to the exact original value — passed. Non-destructive by construction, unlike Razorpay's refund (irreversible; its captured payment's remainder depletes by 100 paise per live run), so this case is safe to run repeatedly against the same test deal, and left the deal in the same state it found it.

  One bug was caught and fixed by this live run that the hermetic and HTTP-boundary suites had not caught: the mutating case's test fixture initially omitted the `proposedAmount` signal (only `amountDeltaAbs`/`amountChangeExceedsThreshold` were set), so `boundSignals`' `proposedAmount` → `parameters.amount` check (SignalIntentBinder) rejected the transaction as a signal/intent mismatch before `PolicyEngine` ever ran, surfacing as an unexpected `403` rather than the intended `200`. This was a test-fixture bug, not a connector or policy bug — the same class of mistake `boundSignals` exists to catch, this time catching a test's own signals payload rather than a caller's. Fixed by including `proposedAmount` in both the nudge and revert transactions' signals.

**Update (SDK dogfooding pass): the live suite now drives every request through the real, published `@parmana/sdk` package, not `supertest`.** Until this pass, this suite — like every other test in this repository — talked to `POST /execute` either via `supertest` against an in-process Express `app` object or a direct `fetch`, never through either maintained SDK's own client. Neither SDK's correctness against a real running server had ever actually been exercised this way; both were verified only by their own dedicated SDK test suites, never by anything else in this codebase actually consuming them. This is the one gated live suite this pass rewrote (HubSpot chosen over Razorpay specifically to avoid combining a real refactor with real-money risk; Razorpay's live suite is unchanged).

`hubspot-live.integration.test.ts` now boots the app on a real, OS-assigned TCP port (`app.listen(0, ...)`, not an in-process object) and drives it with `ParmanaClient`/`HttpTransport` imported from `@parmana/sdk` — the actual installable package, built to `typescript/dist/` and resolved through the npm workspace link (`packages/api/package.json` now depends on it), the same way an external consumer would, not a relative import into `typescript/src/`. Every existing assertion and guardrail is unchanged: the `fetch`-spy "zero real HubSpot calls on policy denial" check still filters on `https://api.hubapi.com`, still passes (the SDK's own request to the local server is a different origin and never matches that filter); the non-existent-deal reachability case now asserts the SDK's typed `InternalServerError` instead of a raw `response.status`; the policy-denial case now asserts the SDK's typed `ExecutionRejectedError` instead of `response.body.code`.

**Precise scope of what this proves, and what it does not:** this session verified the rewritten suite type-checks cleanly against `@parmana/sdk`'s real exported types (no `as unknown as` cast anywhere in it, unlike the version it replaced — see the fixture bug below) and skips cleanly with no import or construction error when `ALLOW_LIVE_HUBSPOT` is unset, which is how it actually ran in this session (no live HubSpot credentials were available in this environment). It was **not** re-run live against a real HubSpot account in this session — that reconfirmation, that the rewritten version still passes 3/3 against a real account the way the supertest-based version did (see the live run documented above), is open work for whoever next has `TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` configured. What the rewrite's correctness does not depend on is untested by this pass, though: `ParmanaClient.execute()`'s HTTP round trip and its error-to-exception mapping (`InternalServerError`, `ExecutionRejectedError`) are the same code paths independently proven, this session, against a real local server by `typescript/test/integration/parmana-client.integration.test.ts` — this suite's live-HubSpot-specific behavior (the actual bytes HubSpot's API returns) is what remains unconfirmed against a real account, not the SDK's own request/response handling.

**A real bug this rewrite found and fixed, the same class of honest disclosure as the fixture bug above:** the suite's own `liveTransaction`/`fetchDealTransaction` helpers built `BusinessTransaction` objects with field names that do not exist on the real schema — `metadata.createdBy`/`metadata.createdAt` instead of `metadata.submittedBy`/`metadata.submittedAt`, `authorization.authorizedAt` instead of `authorization.issuedAt`, plus a `decision` field `BusinessTransaction` does not have at all — forced past the compiler with `as unknown as BusinessTransaction`. Harmless in practice under `supertest` (the server ignores unrecognized fields, and `authorization.issuedAt`'s absence was never validated), which is exactly why it went uncaught: nothing before this pass ever constructed this object against the SDK's real, structurally-checked type. Fixed to the correct field names; the object now satisfies `@parmana/sdk`'s exported `BusinessTransaction` type directly, with no cast.

Evidence

* `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/GatewayHubSpotAdapter.ts`, `createGatewayHubSpotConnector.ts` (the executable connector; Bearer-auth PATCH to HubSpot's CRM API, the deny-by-default property allowlist check, and the placeholder-credential guard)

* `packages/connector-hubspot/src` (`HubSpotCapabilities`, `HubSpotMetadata`, `MockHubSpotServer`, `HubSpotTypes`, `HubSpotDealUpdateSignals`, `HubSpotDealUpdateReceipt`, `HubSpotCapabilityExecution`, `HubSpotSignalStateVerifier` — TD-23)

* `packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/hubspot-connector.test.ts` (moved from connector-hubspot in the Phase 1C migration, 12 tests), `packages/connector-hubspot/tests/unit/hubspot-deal-update-policy.test.ts`, `hubspot-deal-update-signals.test.ts`, `HubSpotSignalStateVerifier.test.ts` (TD-23) — 43 tests total

* `policies/hubspot-deal-update/1.0.0/policy.json`

* `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createHubSpotConnector.ts` (delegates to `createGatewayHubSpotConnector`), `createHubSpotCredentialProvider.ts` (production registration; fails closed, the connector is never registered, when `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` is unset outside test mode), `createHubSpotSignalStateVerifier.ts` (TD-23), `createConnectorRegistry.ts` (conditional registration), `createConnectorAuthenticator.ts` (hubspot added to the trusted connector identity list)

* `packages/api/tests/integration/hubspot-deal-update.integration.test.ts` (3 tests): an approved dealstage update through a real `POST /execute` request against the production bootstrap chain (`createExecutionSystem`), landing on `MockHubSpotServer`; a policy-denied stage transition and a policy-denied over-threshold amount change through the same path, each making zero calls to the mock server (`fetch`-spy asserted)

* `packages/api/tests/integration/hubspot-live.integration.test.ts` (3 tests, gated behind `ALLOW_LIVE_HUBSPOT=1` + `TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` + `TEST_HUBSPOT_DEAL_ID` for the third case; skipped by default) and `packages/api/tests/helpers/hubspot-live-availability.ts` (the gating logic, mirroring `razorpay-live-availability.ts`). Run live in an earlier session with all three variables configured: **3/3 passing** against a real HubSpot developer/test account — reachability, zero-calls-on-denial, and the non-destructive amount nudge-then-revert against the real test deal (redacted `********0850`), all described above.

* SDK dogfooding pass, this session (no live HubSpot credentials available in this environment, so this covers what could actually be checked): `npx tsc --noEmit` against the rewritten file and the full `packages/api/src` project graph, zero errors; `npm run build` in `typescript/` producing `typescript/dist/`, then `node --input-type=module -e "import * as sdk from '@parmana/sdk'; ..."` from the repo root confirming the package resolves through the npm workspace link with every symbol this rewrite imports (`ParmanaClient`, `HttpTransport`, `ExecutionRejectedError`, `InternalServerError`) present; `npx vitest run packages/api/tests/integration/hubspot-live.integration.test.ts` with `ALLOW_LIVE_HUBSPOT` unset, confirming the file imports and skips cleanly (1 file, 3 tests, all skipped — no import, construction, or type error). The live-network-specific assertions above were not re-run.

* `.env.example` (`HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN`, `TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN`, `ALLOW_LIVE_HUBSPOT`, `TEST_HUBSPOT_DEAL_ID`, `HUBSPOT_BASE_URL`)

* Full monorepo suite run this session (`npm test`, `TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN`/`ALLOW_LIVE_HUBSPOT`/`TEST_HUBSPOT_DEAL_ID` configured so the HubSpot live suite ran rather than skipped): 710 passed, 35 skipped (the remaining gated live suites this environment did not opt into — Supabase, Razorpay), 0 failed. A separate, prior run of this same suite with no live credentials configured observed 707 passed / 37 skipped, confirming the HubSpot live suite's 3 tests move cleanly from skipped to passing and nothing else regresses. `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` both clean in both runs.

**Update (Phase 3D certification follow-up):** `redactHubSpotToken` (`HubSpotTypes.ts`) no longer truncates the literal Private App token (previously: first 12 characters plus an ellipsis — for HubSpot the bearer token *is* the entire credential, so this was a genuine fragment of the actual secret). It now returns a one-way, truncated SHA-256 fingerprint (`fp_` + 12 hex chars), preserving the operational "same token used across these executions" signal with zero credential bytes reaching `ConnectorResponse.metadata`, the Trust Record, or the `POST /execute` response body. `hubspot-connector.test.ts`'s redaction test now asserts the response body contains no substring of the token at all.

## 3.11 Durable, Third-Party-Verifiable Refusal and Audit Records (RFC-0021, Scoped)

Every policy `REJECT` decision reachable through `RuntimeEngine.execute` — an ordinary `PolicyEngine.evaluate` rejection or a `SignalIntentBinder` binding-violation rejection (2.15's sibling checks) — produces a signed, durable **Refusal Record**, independently third-party-verifiable the same way an Execution Trust Record's signature is, without requiring a caller credential or database access to check. This closes what was previously true of this codebase: an approved execution left cryptographic evidence behind (the Execution Trust Record and its signature); a refused one left only an HTTP response and whatever the caller's own logs happened to capture.

`RefusalRecordBuilder` (`packages/runtime/src/RefusalRecordBuilder.ts`) builds the record from the rejected transaction, its `Decision`, the executed intent's target/parameters, and any `SignalIntentBinder` violations; `RefusalCrypto` (`packages/crypto/src/RefusalCrypto.ts`) hashes and signs it with the same `FileKeyProvider`/`DEFAULT_KEY_ID` signing stack every other artifact in this document uses — one root of trust, not a separate one for refusals. `POST /refusal/verify` (`packages/api/src/routes/refusal-verify.ts`) verifies a submitted Refusal Record's signature and returns `{ valid }`; like `POST /audit/verify` below, it is deliberately mounted ahead of caller-auth middleware — no API key, no lookup by id, nothing but the artifact itself and Parmana's public key, which is precisely what makes a refusal independently checkable by whoever received the rejection, not only by Parmana.

Separately, and closing the analogous gap for caller-authentication and Razorpay-webhook audit trails (2.16, 2.19, 3.5): every event a **production** audit sink writes is now signed at write time with `AuditEventCrypto` (`packages/crypto/src/AuditEventCrypto.ts`, the same signing stack again), stored alongside the event as a `signature_json` column. `POST /audit/verify` (`packages/api/src/routes/audit-verify.ts`) verifies either shape — `CallerAuditEvent` or `RazorpayWebhookAuditEvent` — through one route, since `AuditEventCrypto.verify()` operates on canonical bytes and a signature alone, never dispatching on the event's own `type`.

**Scope, precisely — two caveats, both load-bearing:**

1. **Refusal Record writing is evidentiary and fails open, deliberately, not fail-closed like caller-auth audit writes (2.19).** `RuntimeEngine.writeRefusalRecord` runs after `Decision` is built but is explicitly barred, by its own comment, from affecting, delaying past that synchronous attempt, or blocking the `executionGate.enforce()` rejection that follows it — a write failure is logged (`refusal_record_write_failed`) and swallowed, never thrown. The rejection itself is unaffected either way: a request that should be denied is still denied, correctly, whether or not its evidentiary record lands. What can be silently missing is the durable proof of *why*, not the correctness of the refusal itself. `RefusalRecordBuilder`/`RefusalRecordRepository` are also optional at construction (`RuntimeFactory`'s `refusalRecords` parameter); when omitted, no Refusal Record is ever written, by design, not by failure. Verified: `packages/runtime/tests/unit/refusal-record-fail-open.test.ts`.
2. **Only production (Supabase) audit sinks sign.** `SupabaseCallerAuditSink` and `SupabaseRazorpayWebhookAuditSink` sign every event; `InMemoryCallerAuditSink` and `InMemoryRazorpayWebhookAuditSink` (test wiring, `NODE_ENV=test`) do not. This claim is therefore about the production deployment path specifically, not every configuration this codebase can run in. Existing rows written before this capability shipped remain unsigned; `signature_json` is nullable and additive, honestly reflecting that history rather than backfilling a signature that was never actually produced at write time.

A third, narrower operational note, not a scope caveat on the claim itself: `SupabaseCallerAuditSink`/`SupabaseRazorpayWebhookAuditSink` currently write via a direct Postgres connection rather than PostgREST, a temporary workaround for a PostgREST schema-cache issue with the new column (Supabase support ticket SU-437429), flagged in both files as revertible once resolved.

Evidence

* `packages/crypto/src/RefusalCrypto.ts`, `AuditEventCrypto.ts`

* `packages/runtime/src/RefusalRecordBuilder.ts`, `RuntimeEngine.ts` (`writeRefusalRecord`, fail-open by design)

* `packages/shared/src/domain/refusal-record.ts`, `repositories/refusal-record-repository.ts`

* `packages/storage/src/memory/MemoryRefusalRecordRepository.ts`, `supabase/SupabaseRefusalRecordRepository.ts`

* `packages/api/src/routes/refusal-verify.ts`, `refusal-get.ts`, `audit-verify.ts`

* `packages/api/src/auth/SupabaseCallerAuditSink.ts`, `InMemoryCallerAuditSink.ts` (signs / does not sign, respectively); `packages/api/src/webhooks/SupabaseRazorpayWebhookAuditSink.ts`, `InMemoryRazorpayWebhookAuditSink.ts` (same split)

* `04-INCIDENTS-LOG.md`, INC-7 ("Audit-sink events were durable but unsigned") — the incident this capability closes, including the PostgREST workaround noted above

* `docs/rfcs/RFC-0021-Refusal-Record.md`

* `packages/api/tests/integration/refusal-record.integration.test.ts` (6 tests), `audit-verify.integration.test.ts` (5 tests): real `POST /refusal/verify` and `POST /audit/verify` HTTP requests — valid signature accepted, tampered payload rejected, mounted ahead of caller-auth (no credential required)

* `packages/runtime/tests/unit/refusal-record-fail-open.test.ts` (2 tests): a Refusal Record write failure does not affect the returned rejection

* `packages/storage/tests/unit/supabase-refusal-record-repository.test.ts` (4 tests)

## 3.12 `@parmana/sign`: Open-Core Extraction of the Signing Primitives (Scoped)

The signing/verification/canonical-hashing primitives this document's cryptography claims (2.13, 2.14, and the hybrid-signing work referenced in `docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-4) rest on have a public, independently maintained counterpart: `@parmana/sign` (`github.com/pavancharak/parmana-sign`), an npm package described in its own README as "signing, verification, and canonical hashing primitives with post-quantum (ML-DSA-65/Dilithium3) support, extracted from Parmana." It ships `SignatureProvider`, `Dilithium3SignatureProvider`, `SignatureVerifier`, `ArtifactHasher`, and `CanonicalSerializer` — the same primitives this repository's `@parmana/crypto` package builds on internally, not a reimplementation.

**This is a genuine open-core split, not "the whole platform is open source."** `@parmana/sign` itself is Apache License 2.0, its own README stating it is "fully usable on its own, independent of Parmana." This repository — the policy engine, `SignalIntentBinder`/signal-state verification, the runtime, and everything else that decides what gets signed and why — remains source-available for evaluation, all rights reserved (see `LICENSE`, root of this repo). Only the cryptographic primitives were extracted and opened; the authorization logic was not.

Independently checkable at the time of this writing: the repository carries an OpenSSF Best Practices passing badge (project #13926) and a weekly/on-push OpenSSF Scorecard, and its README states tagged releases carry SLSA Build Level 3 provenance and are signed keylessly with `cosign` via GitHub's OIDC identity.

**Scope, precisely:** this claim is about the existence, license, and stated security posture of an external repository, verified by fetching it directly — not something this repository's own `npm test` run proves, and not something re-verified on every audit pass of this document. Verifying it currently required an external fetch outside the citation discipline the rest of this document uses (a file, a line, or a specific test in *this* repo); treat this claim as weaker evidentiary footing than every other claim above for that reason. `@parmana/sign`'s `SignatureVerifier` does **not** yet recognize the `signatures`/`schemaVersion` hybrid envelope shape (`docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-4's update) — a third-party verifier using this package today checks the legacy single-signature field only, which is by design (that field is still computed identically for hybrid-signed records) but is not a full hybrid-signature check.

Evidence

* `github.com/pavancharak/parmana-sign` (external repository; README, badge row, `LICENSE`)

* `packages/crypto/src/providers/signature/Dilithium3SignatureProvider.ts`, `SignatureVerifier.ts`, `ArtifactHasher`/`CanonicalSerializer.ts` (this repository's own, internal versions of the same primitives)

## 3.13 Hybrid (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65) Signing Capability (Scoped)

Trust Records and Receipts can be dual-signed with both Ed25519 and ML-DSA-65 (post-quantum) at once, and verification can require both to independently pass. This is a built, tested capability, not yet a deployment: `CRYPTO_MODE` remains `single` by default, Ed25519 alone, everywhere this codebase runs today, including `parmana-api-live.fly.dev` (3.9). This claim is about what exists and is proven correct when explicitly turned on, not about what is currently running.

`HybridSignatureProvider` (`packages/crypto/src/HybridSignatureProvider.ts`) signs an artifact with both algorithms and verifies fail-closed: `verify()` requires exactly one entry matching the primary algorithm and one matching the secondary — a missing, extra, duplicated, or wrong-algorithm entry rejects, never a partial pass. `ExecutionTrustRecord` and `Receipt` (`packages/shared/src/domain/execution-trust-record.ts`, `receipt.ts`) gained two optional fields, `schemaVersion` and `signatures` (an array of `SignatureEntry`, `packages/shared/src/domain/signature-entry.ts`), additive only: the pre-existing single `signature` field is computed exactly as before, over exactly the same canonical content as before, so every record signed before this capability existed — and every record signed after it while `CRYPTO_MODE=single` — verifies completely unchanged. `signatures` is populated, and `schemaVersion` set to `2`, only when `CRYPTO_MODE=hybrid` is active at signing time.

`CRYPTO_MODE` (`packages/shared/src/config/CryptoAlgorithms.ts`'s `CryptoModes`, validated by `parseCryptoMode` in `ConfigValidation.ts` the same way every other config enum in this codebase is — an invalid value now fails closed at startup, rather than the untyped pass-through it was before this capability existed) is read by `VerificationCrypto.signHybrid()` and `ReceiptCrypto.createReceipt()` specifically, not globally: every other signing surface in this codebase (execution authorization, gateway attestation, connector signing) reads only `PRIMARY_SIGNATURE_PROVIDER` and is completely unaffected by `CRYPTO_MODE`, whatever it's set to. `BusinessTrustRecordBuilder` calls `signHybrid()`, in addition to its existing, unchanged `sign()` call, exactly when `CRYPTO_MODE=hybrid`. Verification mirrors this: `VerificationCrypto.verifySignature()` always checks the legacy `signature` field, and additionally, only when a record's `signatures` array is present and non-empty, requires every entry in it to independently verify too — both checks must pass for a hybrid-shaped record; a record with no `signatures` field verifies exactly as it always has.

The secondary (ML-DSA-65) key lives at a distinct keyId, `default-secondary` (`DEFAULT_SECONDARY_KEY_ID`, `packages/crypto/src/KeyProvider.ts`), alongside the existing `default` Ed25519 key under the same `PARMANA_KEY_DIR` — generated with `npm run generate:hybrid-secondary-key`. A missing secondary key file, or `CRYPTO_MODE=hybrid` without `SECONDARY_SIGNATURE_PROVIDER` configured, fails closed (a thrown error, not a silent single-signature fallback) the first time hybrid signing is attempted.

**Required caveat, load-bearing:** `@parmana/sign` (3.12), the public SDK used for independent third-party verification, does not yet recognize the `signatures`/`schemaVersion` envelope shape. Today, a third party verifying a hybrid-signed record through `@parmana/sign` checks the legacy `signature` field only — that check is genuinely correct, not a false pass, since the legacy field remains a real, valid Ed25519 signature over the record. But it is a partial verification: it does not check the ML-DSA-65 signature, and therefore does not confirm the full hybrid guarantee this capability is designed to eventually provide. Updating `@parmana/sign` to recognize the new envelope shape is untracked, separate follow-on work, not part of this capability and not a dependency of it (see 3.12).

Evidence

* `packages/crypto/src/HybridSignatureProvider.ts`

* `packages/shared/src/domain/signature-entry.ts`, `execution-trust-record.ts`, `receipt.ts` (the additive `schemaVersion`/`signatures` fields)

* `packages/shared/src/config/CryptoAlgorithms.ts` (`CryptoModes`), `ConfigValidation.ts` (`parseCryptoMode`), `Config.ts` (`crypto.mode`)

* `packages/crypto/src/VerificationCrypto.ts` (`signHybrid`, hybrid-aware `verifySignature`/`verify`), `ReceiptCrypto.ts` (hybrid-aware `createReceipt`)

* `packages/crypto/src/KeyProvider.ts` (`DEFAULT_SECONDARY_KEY_ID`), `scripts/generate-keypair.ts` (`--force`-gated overwrite protection), `package.json` (`generate:hybrid-secondary-key`)

* `packages/runtime/src/BusinessTrustRecordBuilder.ts` (calls `signHybrid()` additively when `CRYPTO_MODE=hybrid`)

* `packages/crypto/tests/unit/hybrid-signature-provider.test.ts` (7 tests: sign+verify round trip, tampered second signature rejected, second signature missing entirely rejected — not a silent downgrade to single-signature verification, duplicated single-algorithm array rejected, signature from the wrong keypair rejected, tampered artifact rejected, missing secondary key file fails closed on `sign()`)

* `packages/runtime/tests/unit/verification-service-hybrid.test.ts` (4 tests, through the real `BusinessTrustRecordBuilder` → `VerificationService` path): a hybrid-signed record verifies end to end with two independent signature entries present; a legacy-shaped record with `schemaVersion`/`signatures` stripped still verifies unchanged even while the process runs `CRYPTO_MODE=hybrid`; a hybrid record with a corrupted secondary signature is rejected; a hybrid record with the secondary signature stripped entirely is rejected

* `packages/runtime/tests/integration/receipt-hybrid.integration.test.ts` (2 tests, through the real `ReceiptService` path): a hybrid-signed Receipt's `signatures` independently re-verify via `HybridSignatureProvider` from outside the class that produced them; a tampered hybrid Receipt signature is rejected

* `packages/shared/tests/unit/config-validation.test.ts` (`parseCryptoMode` cases: selects the configured mode, defaults to `single` when unset, throws naming the invalid value)

* `docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-4 (the gap-tracking record of exactly which signing surfaces this covers and which it doesn't)

## 3.14 Per-Caller Rate Limiting on `/execute` (Scoped)

`POST /execute` — the endpoint that signs and writes to the database on every request — enforces a per-caller rate limit, closing a gap found during live load testing of `parmana-api.fly.dev`: no rate limiting existed anywhere in this codebase at all, confirmed both by code review (no rate-limiting package in any `package.json`) and empirically, by firing several thousand unthrottled requests against the live deployment with zero `429`s at any concurrency level tested. `GET /health` and `GET /ready` carry a separate, far more permissive limit, since both are cheap, unauthenticated, and legitimately polled on a fixed interval by PaaS health-check infrastructure (`fly.toml`'s own check runs every 30s per machine).

The `/execute` limiter is keyed by authenticated caller identity (`req.callerId`, set by caller-auth), not by IP — a design-partner integration commonly calls from a shared backend IP, where an IP-keyed limit would either starve every caller behind it or be loose enough to mean nothing. It is mounted only when caller authentication is enabled (`createApp`'s `callerAuth` option is not `"disabled"`): there is no caller identity to key off when auth is off, and rate-limiting a route with no caller identity by falling back to IP would silently become the exact IP-keyed control this design deliberately avoids. Both limits are configurable (`RATE_LIMIT_EXECUTE_PER_MINUTE`, default 30; `RATE_LIMIT_HEALTH_PER_MINUTE`, default 300 — see `.env.example`), sized for a design-partner evaluation deployment, not high-volume production traffic. A rejected request returns `429` with a clear `{ "error", "code": "RATE_LIMITED" }` body and a `Retry-After` header, and never reaches `BusinessTransactionMapper`, policy evaluation, or `RuntimeAuthorizationSigner` — no nonce is consumed and nothing is signed for a request this middleware rejects, confirmed directly: a rate-limited request produces zero new execution-audit events.

**Scope, precisely, mirroring 3.2's own caveat for `NonceStore`:** the limiter's store is `express-rate-limit`'s default, in-memory, single-process store. This deployment runs two Fly machines, each counting independently — the effective ceiling for a given caller is `RATE_LIMIT_EXECUTE_PER_MINUTE × machineCount`, not a fleet-wide limit enforced once across every machine. A shared store (Redis or equivalent) would close that gap; none is wired in, and this claim does not represent one as existing.

Evidence

* `packages/api/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts` (`createExecuteRateLimiter`, `createHealthReadyRateLimiter`)
* `packages/api/src/app.ts` (mounting: health/ready limiter shared across both routes; execute limiter conditional on `callerAuth !== "disabled"`, mounted ahead of `createExecuteRouter`)
* `packages/shared/src/config/Config.ts` (`RateLimitConfig`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXECUTE_PER_MINUTE` / `RATE_LIMIT_HEALTH_PER_MINUTE`, defaults 30/300)
* `packages/api/tests/integration/rate-limit.integration.test.ts`: normal traffic under the limit passes unaffected; traffic over the limit gets a clean 429 with `Retry-After` and zero new execution-audit events; a rate-limited caller does not block a different caller's traffic (per-key, not global); the health/ready limiter is shared across both routes; rate limiting is skipped entirely when `callerAuth` is `"disabled"`; an omitted `rateLimit` option falls back to the documented defaults

## 3.15 SDK Dogfooding: Documented Quickstarts Now Proven to Actually Run (Scoped)

**Scope, precisely:** this claim covers the two documented "quickstart" example scripts — `python/examples/quickstart/run.py` and its closest TypeScript equivalent, `typescript/examples/02-execute.ts` — now being proven to actually work by an automated test, plus the real bugs found while proving that. It does **not** cover the other 11 numbered example scripts in `python/examples/`, the other 4 in `typescript/examples/`, or either SDK's full API surface; those remain unexercised by any test, same as before this pass. It is a narrower, complementary claim to 3.10's HubSpot-live-suite-through-the-SDK update above, not a restatement of it — that one is about a *test suite* driving requests through an SDK; this one is about *documentation examples* being provably correct, not just plausible-looking code that happens to parse.

Before this pass, both quickstart scripts already imported their respective SDK (`parmana` / `@parmana/sdk`) rather than raw HTTP — that part did not need rewriting. What neither had was anything that actually *ran* them: `typescript/examples/` is explicitly excluded from `typescript/tsconfig.json`'s own `include` list, so nothing in this repository has ever built, type-checked, or executed it, and no test imported `python/examples/quickstart/run.py` either. Both were, until now, hand-written code that had never been mechanically proven to still work as the surrounding schema evolved.

**What dogfooding this found, checked directly against the current schema and each SDK's actual exported members, not assumed:**

* Every file in `typescript/examples/` (5 example scripts, 2 shared helpers) imported `@parmana/typescript-sdk` — a package name that has never existed anywhere in this repository's history, under any name this workspace has ever had (`@parmana/legacy-reference` before this session's earlier TypeScript-SDK-audit pass, `@parmana/sdk` after it). None of these files could have ever been run as committed.
* `typescript/examples/02-execute.ts` and `typescript/examples/shared/transaction.ts` referenced `AuthorityType.USER` and `BusinessTransactionStatus.RECEIVED` as if they were runtime enum members. This SDK's hand-maintained models type both fields as plain `string`/string-union types with no such runtime enum exported at all (`import * as sdk from "@parmana/sdk"; sdk.AuthorityType` is `undefined`) — both files would have thrown immediately on execution.
* `typescript/examples/04-replay.ts` called `client.replay({ businessTransactionId: "..." })`, an object, where `ParmanaClient.replay()` takes a plain `string` — would have sent a malformed request path.
* `python/examples/quickstart/run.py` passed plain Python strings (`"SERVICE"`, `"RECEIVED"`) where the real generated dataclasses (`Authority.authority_type`, `BusinessTransaction.status`) declare actual `AuthorityType`/`BusinessTransactionStatus` enum types — confirmed by `mypy`, not inferred. Harmless on the wire (a `str, Enum` member and a plain string with the same value serialize identically, so this never caused a wrong request), but a genuine type-safety defect the language's own type checker would have caught immediately had anything ever run it in that mode.

All four fixed. `typescript/examples/02-execute.ts` was additionally refactored into an exported `runExecuteExample(endpoint?)` (previously a bare top-level script with no importable entry point) and `python/examples/quickstart/run.py`'s body into an exported `run_quickstart(endpoint?)` returning the `ExecutionTrustRecord` — both changes made specifically so a test could call them, not a stylistic preference.

**Now proven, present tense, by a real running server each `npm test` / `pytest` run boots:** `typescript/test/integration/examples.integration.test.ts` imports and calls `runExecuteExample` against a real local server and asserts a signed, `APPROVED` Execution Trust Record comes back. `python/tests/test_quickstart_example.py` does the same for `run_quickstart`, additionally asserting the script's own documented printed output (README.md's "Expected output" section) still matches what it actually prints. `python/examples/quickstart/README.md`'s prerequisites and sample output, which still referenced the removed `payments:execute`/`vendor-payment` capability and its `VENDOR_PAYMENT_TOKEN` (docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md G-27 removed it entirely, before this pass), were rewritten from a real captured run against `test:fixture-execute`, the fixture this script has actually targeted since that removal.

Evidence

* `typescript/examples/01-health.ts`, `02-execute.ts`, `03-verify.ts`, `04-replay.ts`, `05-policy-validation.ts`, `shared/client.ts`, `shared/transaction.ts` (package-name fix, all 7 files); `02-execute.ts`, `shared/transaction.ts` (enum-misuse fix); `04-replay.ts` (`client.replay()` argument fix)
* `typescript/test/integration/examples.integration.test.ts` (1 test): runs `runExecuteExample` against a real local server, asserts `trustRecordId` present, one `APPROVED` execution, `ed25519` signature
* `python/examples/quickstart/run.py` (`run_quickstart` extraction, `AuthorityType`/`BusinessTransactionStatus` enum fix); `python/examples/quickstart/README.md` (stale prerequisites/output rewritten from a real run)
* `python/tests/test_quickstart_example.py` (1 test): spawns a real local server with caller-auth disabled (matching the documented manual setup exactly, since `run_quickstart` never supplies an `api_key`), runs `run_quickstart` against it, asserts the returned record and the script's own printed output both match
* `mypy examples/quickstart/run.py` (Python): 3 errors before this pass's enum fix (2 real type mismatches plus one pre-existing, unrelated `datetime.UTC` 3.10-compatibility notice, unchanged), 1 after (only the unrelated notice remains)
* `npx tsc --noEmit` against `typescript/examples/**/*.ts` (TypeScript, checked directly — `typescript/tsconfig.json` itself does not cover this directory): clean after all fixes

## 3.16 Caller-to-Capability Scoping (Scoped)

Extends `ApiKeyEntry` with an optional `allowedCapabilities` field: the set of capabilities (`Intent.action` values, e.g. `hubspot:deal-update`) a given key may invoke. Checked in `execute.ts`/`transactions.ts` before the transaction ever reaches `application.execute()` — i.e. before `CapabilityPolicyBinder`/`PolicyEngine.evaluate` are reached, neither of which is caller-aware by design (2.24, 2.16's own G-28 note). A caller attempting a capability outside its grant is rejected `403 CAPABILITY_NOT_ALLOWED` and the denial is audited (`caller.capability_denied`, `CallerAuditSink`), never silently. The default is fail-closed and deliberately the opposite of `allowedPrincipalIds`' own default: an unset or empty `allowedCapabilities` denies every capability — there is no "may invoke its own capability" fallback the way there is a "may only assert itself" fallback for principals. The literal string `"*"` is an explicit, auditable wildcard grant, never an implicit default. `GET /callers/me` returns an authenticated caller's own resolved identity and scope (`callerId`, `allowedPrincipalIds`, `allowedCapabilities`, `unrestrictedCapabilities`) — self-lookup only, no key material — as the proof artifact a security review can point to.

**Scope, precisely — this is the load-bearing caveat for this claim:** this mechanism is implemented, tested, and enforced for every caller that authenticates through a caller-auth-enabled path. It does **not** currently apply to the capability actually reachable in production. **Update (2026-08-12): the Razorpay connector was deliberately removed from this codebase** (see the removal commit and CLAIMS.md's historical §3.8/§3.9) — `razorpay:refund-create` and the other Razorpay capabilities no longer exist here at all, not merely "unscoped." `hubspot:deal-fetch` and `hubspot:deal-update` remain the only production-reachable capabilities, and neither is scoped by caller yet: `hubspot-deal-update.integration.test.ts`/`hubspot-live.integration.test.ts` still construct their app with `callerAuth: "disabled"` — no `ApiKeyEntry` exists for that connector path at all, so there is no caller identity for `allowedCapabilities` to scope in the first place. Concretely: **do not read this claim as "Parmana's live CRM-moving (HubSpot) capabilities are now scope-restricted" — they are not, yet.** Today this protects only callers that go through caller-auth-enabled paths, which at present are test and tutorial callers scoped to the single generic `test:fixture-execute` capability (`NODE_ENV=test`-only). Enabling caller-auth on the HubSpot connector integration path itself is the follow-on work that would make this mechanism meaningful for the one capability that actually moves CRM state; that work has not been started (see Future Claims, §4).

Evidence

* `packages/shared/src/config/ApiKeyEntry.ts` (`allowedCapabilities`, fail-closed-by-default doc comment, `"*"` wildcard convention)
* `packages/shared/src/config/ConfigValidation.ts` (`parseApiKeys` validates `allowedCapabilities` the same way as `allowedPrincipalIds`)
* `packages/api/src/auth/isCapabilityAllowed.ts` (fail-closed check, wildcard handling)
* `packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts` / `transactions.ts` (enforced before `application.execute()`; `403 CAPABILITY_NOT_ALLOWED`; denial audited via `recordCallerAuditEvent`)
* `packages/api/src/auth/CallerAuditSink.ts` (`caller.capability_denied` event type, `capability` field)
* `packages/api/src/routes/callers-me.ts` (`GET /callers/me`, resolved identity/scope, no key material)
* `supabase/migrations/20260812120000_add_capability_to_caller_audit_events.sql` (additive `capability` column, widened `type` CHECK constraint; not yet applied to any live project)
* `packages/api/tests/unit/isCapabilityAllowed.test.ts`, `packages/api/tests/integration/caller-capability-scoping.integration.test.ts` (allow/deny/fail-closed-default/wildcard, denial precedes policy evaluation, audit content, `/callers/me` self-lookup and resolved-defaults)
* Repo-wide check confirming zero caller-auth-enabled test or production wiring exists for `hubspot:deal-update`: `hubspot-deal-update.integration.test.ts`, `hubspot-live.integration.test.ts` both construct their app with `callerAuth: "disabled"`. The Razorpay connector this section previously cited the same way no longer exists in this codebase at all (removed 2026-08-12).

# Maturity Assessment (TRL)



This is the repo owner's own maturity assessment, layered on the evidence already cited above. It is not a new technical claim in the sense sections 2 and 3 use that word, and it does not carry its own separate test evidence — it is an interpretation of evidence that does.

**Historical**: Parmana reached **Technology Readiness Level 7** (system prototype demonstration in an operational environment) as of 2026-07-20, on the strength of §3.8/§3.9 — a real refund, a real Razorpay-initiated webhook delivery to a standing public endpoint, settled end to end, in both Razorpay test mode and live mode. That evidence is now historical (§3.8/§3.9 above, both marked "Historical: Razorpay connector removed 2026-08-12"; `docs/site/trust-and-claims/trl7-verification.mdx`; `docs/site/changelog.mdx`) — the connector was deliberately removed 2026-08-12, and TRL 7's defining element here (an external party closing the loop against a standing public deployment) has no current equivalent in this codebase.

**Current assessment, without relying on removed evidence: Technology Readiness Level 6** (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment). Basis: §3.10's HubSpot connector is proven correct against a real, relevant external system — HubSpot's actual production API, including a real, non-destructive read-nudge-revert mutation on a real account (§3.10's live suite, most recently confirmed 3/3 passing in an earlier session; not re-confirmed live in the most recent SDK-dogfooding pass — see that section's own caveat). What's missing relative to TRL 7: HubSpot's live proof runs through a locally-booted test server, not Parmana's actual public Fly deployment (no HubSpot deployment was ever documented in DEPLOYMENT.md), and HubSpot has no webhook — there is no case, current or historical, of an external party initiating a delivery against a standing Parmana public endpoint for HubSpot the way Razorpay's webhook did.

Not claimed by this assessment: sustained volume, load-bearing traffic, high availability, multi-tenant production operation, or any current standing-public-endpoint proof for any capability.

# 4. Future Claims (Pending Evidence)



The following claims are planned but are intentionally withheld until supported by implementation, testing, audit, and documented proof.




* [FUTURE] HubSpot Contacts and Companies objects: no implementation exists. The HubSpot connector (3.10) covers Deal `dealstage`/`amount` update only.

* [FUTURE] HubSpot deal delete/archive: no implementation exists; deny-by-default this milestone touches only `dealstage`/`amount` on existing deals.

* [FUTURE] HubSpot webhook/event-driven trigger: no implementation exists. This milestone is request-response only (`POST /execute` → connector PATCH); there is no asynchronous confirmation loop analogous to the Razorpay refund connector's webhook receipt (3.5) and settlement closure (3.6/3.7/3.8/3.9) — those took four scoped milestones to build for Razorpay, and none of that has been started for HubSpot.

* [FUTURE] Caller-auth enabled on the HubSpot connector integration path: not started. 3.16's caller-to-capability scoping mechanism is implemented and tested, but the connector path currently runs with `callerAuth: "disabled"` and no `ApiKeyEntry`, so `hubspot:deal-update` — the only capability actually reachable in production, following the Razorpay connector's removal — is not scoped by caller today. This is the specific follow-on work that would make 3.16 meaningful for real CRM-moving traffic, not merely test fixtures.

* [FUTURE] HubSpot multi-object transactions: no implementation exists; each `hubspot:deal-update` call is a single Deal PATCH, not a coordinated multi-object write.

* [FUTURE] HubSpot per-pipeline stage-transition configuration: `HUBSPOT_DEFAULT_STAGE_ORDER` (3.10) is one global stage order; `isHubSpotStageTransitionAllowed` accepts a `stageOrder` override but nothing wires it to a deal's actual `pipeline` property yet — see 3.10's "open decisions" for what this would take.

* [FUTURE] Stripe connector: no implementation exists; would implement @parmana/connector-sdk's Connector interface.

* [FUTURE] GitHub connector: no implementation exists.

* [FUTURE] Salesforce connector: no implementation exists.

* [FUTURE] SAP connector: no implementation exists.

* [FUTURE] ServiceNow connector: no implementation exists.

* [FUTURE] Workday connector: no implementation exists.

* [FUTURE] Slack connector: no implementation exists.

* [FUTURE] Jira connector: no implementation exists.

* [FUTURE] Database connector: no implementation exists.

* [FUTURE] Cloud credential providers: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Google Secret Manager CredentialProvider implementations. Only the CredentialProvider interface seam exists today (StaticCredentialProvider, EnvironmentCredentialProvider); no cloud SDK dependency has been added.

* Every production Runtime enforces the canonical trust pipeline.

* Every production API request executes through the canonical runtime. **Reconciliation note (not a promotion — remains withheld pending whatever broader evidence standard this section applies):** Phase 3D's Property C bypass search (`docs/architecture/phase3d-independent-authorization-certification.md` §5.2) traced every route `packages/api/src/app.ts` mounts and confirmed only `POST /execute` reaches `application.execute()`/`RuntimeEngine`; every other route is read-only, verification-only, or a passive audit sink that never calls `executionSystem.execute()` or any connector. This is direct, current evidence bearing on this specific claim, scoped to the routes and connectors that exist today — flagged here so it isn't lost, without this reconciliation pass itself deciding whether it now meets this section's bar for promotion to §2.

* Replay semantically verifies every trust artifact.

* Every guarantee is fully proven through conformance testing.

* Every guarantee includes complete independent verification evidence.

* A general, named credential-brokering *mechanism* — a formal product capability letting an arbitrary future connector class (e.g. third-party cloud credentials via AWS STS, per `02-REMAINING.md`'s Tier 2 roadmap) prove "AI never possesses execution credentials" without bespoke per-connector work — does not exist; only the `CredentialProvider`/session-credential-vault pattern each connector individually implements does. **Narrowed by Phase 3D (2.22/2.23):** for the two connectors that exist today (Razorpay, HubSpot), the underlying property this future item describes — the AI-facing `/execute` request path never comes into possession of the raw connector credential, which is resolved only after authorization is fully decided, confined to the connector-execution layer — was independently traced end-to-end and verified true (`docs/architecture/phase3d-independent-authorization-certification.md` §3). What remains genuinely future is only the generalized, connector-class-agnostic mechanism, not the property itself for these two connectors. (Certification's own disclosed caveat, 2.23: a short, non-functional fingerprint of the credential, not the credential itself, reaches the caller-visible response — see 3.4/3.10.)

* Enterprise-grade key custody: current key storage is local PEM files read by FileKeyProvider; no KMS, HSM, or cloud key vault integration exists.

* Authority, Intent, and Evidence verification checks in verification-service.ts. Only integrity, signature, and authorization binding are implemented today (2.15). The prior six-stage pipeline package (@parmana/verification) was retired in Session 5; it had no real implementation and no real test coverage; its stage architecture is not being resurrected. Authority/Intent/Evidence checks, if built, will be added directly to verification-service.ts. Tracked for Session 6.

* Algorithm migration: re-keying from one signature provider to another (for example Ed25519 to ML-DSA-65) while retaining the ability to verify previously-signed records. AuthorizationVerifier does not dispatch verification based on the envelope's algorithm field; a verifying process supports exactly one configured SIGNATURE_PROVIDER at a time.

* [FUTURE] `CRYPTO_MODE=hybrid` running anywhere in staging or production: the capability described in 3.13 is built and tested but not wired into any deployed environment. `PRIMARY_SIGNATURE_PROVIDER=ed25519` alone remains the configuration everywhere this codebase currently runs, including `parmana-api-live.fly.dev` (3.9).

* [FUTURE] `@parmana/sign` recognizing the hybrid `signatures`/`schemaVersion` envelope shape (3.13's own caveat): third-party verification of a hybrid-signed record via the public SDK today checks only the legacy Ed25519 `signature` field, a genuine but partial verification. No work on `@parmana/sign` itself is in scope of this repository.



These claims will be promoted to the Supported Technical Claims section only after the required evidence is complete.

# 5. Claims We Intentionally Do Not Make



Parmana intentionally avoids claims that exceed the available implementation evidence.



Examples include:



* Execution is impossible to bypass under all circumstances.

* Mathematical proof of execution correctness.

* Cryptographic proof of every aspect of runtime behavior.

* Guaranteed regulatory compliance.

* Absolute prevention of all unauthorized execution.

* Tamper-proof operation in every deployment environment.

* Elimination of all software defects or operational risks.

* "Non-bypassable" or "the single execution authority" as an unscoped, system-wide claim. Envelope verification (@parmana/envelope-verifier) is opt-in per receiving endpoint and enforces nothing at the network level; see Conditional Claim 3.1 for the scoped version of this claim that is actually supported.

* Deterministic signature output for post-quantum (ML-DSA-65) signing. ML-DSA-65 signatures are randomized by design: signing the same message twice with the same key produces two different, independently valid signatures. Only signature verification is deterministic. Determinism-of-output claims (2.8) apply to Ed25519 only.



Such claims depend on deployment environments, operational controls, and assumptions beyond the scope of the reference implementation.
