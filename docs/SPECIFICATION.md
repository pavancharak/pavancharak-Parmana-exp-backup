\# Parmana Specification



Version: 1.0



Status: Normative



\---



\# Purpose



This specification defines the normative behavior of the Parmana Execution Trust Infrastructure.



Any implementation claiming compatibility with Parmana should conform to this specification.



Normative keywords such as \*\*MUST\*\*, \*\*MUST NOT\*\*, \*\*SHOULD\*\*, \*\*SHOULD NOT\*\*, and \*\*MAY\*\* are used as defined by RFC 2119.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* canonical execution model

\* trust chain

\* business transaction model

\* policy selection

\* policy evaluation

\* runtime execution

\* execution evidence

\* verification

\* replay



This specification does not define:



\* business policies

\* authentication systems

\* identity providers

\* workflow orchestration

\* AI models



\---



\# Canonical Trust Chain



A conforming implementation MUST model execution using the following trust chain.



```text

Authority

&#x20;   ↓

Authorization

&#x20;   ↓

Intent

&#x20;   ↓

Business Transaction

&#x20;   ↓

Policy Reference

&#x20;   ↓

Policy

&#x20;   ↓

Decision

&#x20;   ↓

Execution

&#x20;   ↓

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;   ↓

Receipt

&#x20;   ↓

Verification

&#x20;   ↓

Replay

```



Each artifact MUST be explicitly linked to its predecessor.



\---



\# Business Transaction



A Business Transaction MUST include:



\* Business Transaction identifier

\* Transaction metadata

\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* Policy Reference

\* Runtime signals

\* Status

\* Creation timestamp



The Business Transaction SHALL be treated as immutable after acceptance.



\---



\# Trust Relationships



A conforming implementation MUST enforce the following relationships.



\* Authorization.authorityId MUST equal Authority.authorityId.

\* Intent.authorizationId MUST equal Authorization.authorizationId.

\* BusinessTransaction.businessTransactionId MUST equal Metadata.businessTransactionId.

\* PolicyReference MUST identify exactly one policy.



\---



\# Policy Selection



Policy selection MUST be deterministic.



The runtime:



\* MUST load the policy explicitly referenced by the Business Transaction.

\* MUST validate policy identity and version.

\* MUST NOT discover policies.

\* MUST NOT automatically select the latest version.

\* MUST NOT substitute a different policy.



\---



\# Policy Evaluation



Policy evaluation MUST be deterministic.



The implementation:



\* MUST evaluate rules sequentially.

\* MUST stop at the first matching rule.

\* MUST record the matched rule.

\* MUST record the decision reason.

\* MUST record the evaluation trace.



For identical policy inputs and runtime signals, evaluation SHOULD produce the same decision outcome, excluding intentionally variable runtime metadata such as timestamps or generated identifiers.



\---



\# Runtime Execution



Execution MUST occur only after:



\* trust validation

\* policy evaluation

\* approved decision



Execution MUST NOT occur when the decision outcome is not approved.



\---



\# Execution Trust Record



Every successful execution MUST produce an Execution Trust Record.



The Trust Record MUST include:



\* Business Transaction

\* Execution

\* Overrides (if any)

\* Verification artifacts

\* Receipts

\* Canonical Trust Record hash



The Trust Record SHALL be treated as immutable evidence.



\---



\# Receipt



Every Receipt MUST include:



\* Trust Record reference

\* Cryptographic signature

\* Signature algorithm



Receipts MUST be verifiable independently of the runtime.



\---



\# Verification



A conforming implementation MUST support verification of execution evidence.



Verification MUST confirm the integrity of the supplied execution artifacts.



Verification MUST NOT modify execution evidence.



\---



\# Replay



Replay SHOULD support re-evaluation of previously recorded execution.



Replay SHOULD detect differences between the recorded execution and the replayed execution.



Replay MUST NOT modify historical evidence.



\---



\# Architectural Constraints



A conforming implementation:



\* MUST separate policy evaluation from runtime execution.

\* MUST separate execution from verification.

\* MUST separate verification from replay.

\* MUST preserve immutable execution evidence.



\---



\# Security Requirements



Implementations SHOULD:



\* use canonical serialization for hashing

\* use cryptographically secure hashing algorithms

\* use digital signatures for receipts

\* validate execution integrity before verification



Specific cryptographic algorithms are implementation choices unless otherwise specified.



\---



\# Conformance



An implementation conforms to this specification when it:



\* implements the required trust chain

\* satisfies the documented guarantees

\* passes the conformance test suite

\* produces verifiable execution evidence



Conformance requirements are further defined in `CONFORMANCE.md`.
