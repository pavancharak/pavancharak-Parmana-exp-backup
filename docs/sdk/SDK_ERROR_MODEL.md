\# Parmana SDK Error Model



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0

\*\*Status:\*\* Canonical

\*\*Applies To:\*\* All Official Parmana SDKs



\---



\# 1. Purpose



This document defines the canonical error model implemented by every official Parmana SDK.



The objective of the error model is to provide:



\* predictable behavior

\* consistent error handling

\* language-independent semantics

\* strongly typed exceptions

\* forward compatibility



Every official SDK MUST implement the concepts defined in this document.



\---



\# 2. Design Principles



The Parmana SDK error model follows these principles.



\## Strongly Typed



Applications MUST handle structured error types rather than parsing error messages.



\---



\## Deterministic



Identical failures MUST produce the same error category.



\---



\## Stable



Future SDK versions MAY introduce additional error types but MUST NOT change the meaning of existing ones.



\---



\## Product-Oriented



Errors represent failures in interacting with Parmana as a platform.



They do not expose internal implementation details.



\---



\# 3. Error Hierarchy



Every SDK MUST expose the following hierarchy.



```text

ParmanaError

│

├── ConfigurationError

├── ValidationError

├── AuthenticationError

├── AuthorizationError

├── ExecutionRejectedError

├── VerificationError

├── ReplayError

├── NetworkError

├── TimeoutError

└── InternalServerError

```



Language-specific inheritance may vary while preserving these semantics.



\---



\# 4. ParmanaError



Base class for every SDK error.



Every SDK exception MUST inherit from ParmanaError.



Required information:



\* error code

\* message

\* optional cause

\* optional request identifier

\* optional metadata



\---



\# 5. ConfigurationError



Raised when the SDK configuration is invalid.



Examples:



\* missing endpoint

\* malformed URL

\* invalid credentials

\* unsupported transport

\* invalid retry policy



Example:



```text

ConfigurationError



Invalid Runtime endpoint.

```



\---



\# 6. ValidationError



Raised before a request is sent to Parmana.



Typical causes:



\* missing required field

\* malformed request

\* invalid identifier

\* invalid schema

\* serialization failure



Examples:



```text

BusinessTransaction is missing.

```



```text

Intent identifier is invalid.

```



ValidationError represents client-side validation failures.



\---



\# 7. AuthenticationError



Raised when authentication fails.



Examples:



\* invalid API key

\* expired token

\* missing credentials

\* unsupported authentication method



AuthenticationError indicates that the client identity could not be established.



\---



\# 8. AuthorizationError



Raised when the caller lacks permission to perform an operation.



Examples:



\* insufficient privileges

\* unauthorized runtime operation

\* restricted resource



AuthorizationError concerns the caller's permissions.



It does NOT represent policy evaluation.



\---



\# 9. ExecutionRejectedError



Raised when Parmana rejects execution.



Examples:



\* Decision outcome is REJECTED

\* execution denied by policy

\* execution blocked by runtime enforcement



This is the canonical SDK representation of execution rejection.



Example:



```text

Execution rejected.



Reason:

Payment amount exceeds approval threshold.

```



\---



\# 10. VerificationError



Raised when execution verification fails.



Examples:



\* invalid trust record

\* evidence mismatch

\* receipt mismatch

\* integrity verification failure



VerificationError indicates that execution could not be independently verified.



\---



\# 11. ReplayError



Raised when deterministic replay fails.



Examples:



\* missing execution artifacts

\* replay mismatch

\* inconsistent replay state

\* unsupported replay request



ReplayError does not indicate runtime failure.



It indicates replay failure.



\---



\# 12. NetworkError



Raised when communication with the Parmana Runtime fails.



Examples:



\* DNS failure

\* TLS failure

\* connection refused

\* transport interruption



NetworkError occurs before Parmana processes the request.



\---



\# 13. TimeoutError



Raised when the configured timeout expires.



Examples:



\* request timeout

\* connection timeout

\* read timeout



TimeoutError does not imply that execution failed.



Only that the SDK did not receive a response within the configured timeout.



\---



\# 14. InternalServerError



Raised when the Parmana Runtime encounters an unexpected internal failure.



Examples:



\* unexpected runtime exception

\* unavailable subsystem

\* internal processing failure



Applications SHOULD log InternalServerError and retry only when appropriate.



\---



\# 15. Error Codes



Every SDK error SHOULD expose a stable machine-readable code.



Examples:



```text

CONFIGURATION\_ERROR



VALIDATION\_ERROR



AUTHENTICATION\_ERROR



AUTHORIZATION\_ERROR



EXECUTION\_REJECTED



VERIFICATION\_FAILED



REPLAY\_FAILED



NETWORK\_ERROR



TIMEOUT



INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR

```



Error codes are stable across SDK implementations.



\---



\# 16. Error Messages



Human-readable messages:



\* SHOULD explain the failure.

\* SHOULD avoid implementation details.

\* SHOULD not expose sensitive information.

\* SHOULD remain concise.



Applications MUST NOT depend on message text.



\---



\# 17. Error Metadata



SDKs MAY include additional metadata.



Examples:



```text

requestId



traceId



executionTrustRecordId



businessTransactionId



timestamp



runtimeVersion

```



Metadata must never alter the meaning of the error.



\---



\# 18. Retry Guidance



Recommended behavior:



| Error                  | Retry       |

| ---------------------- | ----------- |

| ConfigurationError     | No          |

| ValidationError        | No          |

| AuthenticationError    | No          |

| AuthorizationError     | No          |

| ExecutionRejectedError | No          |

| VerificationError      | No          |

| ReplayError            | No          |

| NetworkError           | Yes         |

| TimeoutError           | Yes         |

| InternalServerError    | Conditional |



Retries should follow the configured retry policy.



\---



\# 19. Language Mapping



Every SDK must preserve the same conceptual hierarchy.



Example:



TypeScript



```text

ParmanaError

&#x20;   ├── ValidationError

&#x20;   ├── ExecutionRejectedError

```



Python



```text

ParmanaError

&#x20;   ├── ValidationError

&#x20;   ├── ExecutionRejectedError

```



The inheritance syntax may differ.



The semantics must remain identical.



\---



\# 20. Logging



SDKs SHOULD log:



\* error code

\* request identifier

\* timestamp



SDKs SHOULD NOT log:



\* credentials

\* secrets

\* authorization tokens

\* private business data



\---



\# 21. Compatibility



New SDK versions MAY introduce additional error types.



Existing error types MUST preserve their semantics.



Existing applications must continue to function without modification.



\---



\# 22. Conformance Requirements



An official Parmana SDK MUST:



\* expose ParmanaError as the base error

\* implement the canonical error hierarchy

\* preserve canonical error semantics

\* expose stable error codes

\* avoid exposing internal runtime exceptions

\* provide structured error information

\* maintain language parity with other official SDKs



\---



\# Summary



The Parmana SDK Error Model provides a stable, language-independent framework for representing failures when interacting with the Parmana Execution Trust Infrastructure.



By exposing structured, deterministic, and strongly typed errors while hiding internal implementation details, the SDK enables applications to handle failures consistently across all official Parmana SDK implementations.
