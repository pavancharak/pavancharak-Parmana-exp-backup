\# Parmana SDK Configuration



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0

\*\*Status:\*\* Canonical

\*\*Applies To:\*\* All Official Parmana SDKs



\---



\# 1. Purpose



This document defines the canonical configuration model for all official Parmana SDKs.



The configuration model provides a consistent mechanism for connecting SDKs to the Parmana Runtime while remaining independent of programming language.



Every official SDK MUST implement the concepts defined in this document.



\---



\# 2. Design Goals



The SDK configuration model is designed to be:



\* Simple

\* Explicit

\* Secure by default

\* Environment-independent

\* Language-independent

\* Forward compatible



\---



\# 3. Configuration Philosophy



Configuration defines \*\*how the SDK communicates with Parmana\*\*.



It does \*\*not\*\* configure:



\* policy behavior

\* runtime authorization

\* execution rules

\* verification logic

\* replay behavior



Those are runtime responsibilities.



\---



\# 4. Configuration Components



Every SDK configuration consists of the following logical components.



```text

Configuration

├── Runtime Endpoint

├── Authentication

├── Transport

├── Timeout

├── Retry Policy

├── TLS

├── Logging

└── User Agent

```



\---



\# 5. Runtime Endpoint



Every SDK MUST specify the Parmana Runtime endpoint.



Examples



```text

https://runtime.company.com



http://localhost:8080

```



The endpoint identifies the Runtime that processes SDK requests.



\---



\# 6. Authentication



Authentication identifies the calling application.



SDKs MUST support authentication independently from transport.



The authentication mechanism is implementation-specific.



Possible authentication methods include:



\* API Key

\* Bearer Token

\* Mutual TLS

\* Future enterprise authentication mechanisms



SDKs MUST NOT embed credentials in source code.



\---



\# 7. Transport



The transport layer defines how requests are sent.



Supported transports are implementation-specific.



Current transport



```text

HTTP/HTTPS

```



Future transports MAY include:



\* gRPC

\* Message Queue

\* Enterprise Connectors



Applications should not depend on transport-specific behavior.



\---



\# 8. Timeout



SDKs MUST allow configuration of request timeouts.



Timeouts SHOULD apply to:



\* connection establishment

\* request transmission

\* response reception



Timeout values are SDK implementation details.



\---



\# 9. Retry Policy



Retry behavior must be configurable.



A retry policy may define:



\* maximum attempts

\* retry interval

\* exponential backoff

\* retry conditions



SDKs SHOULD retry only transient failures.



SDKs MUST NOT retry deterministic failures such as:



\* ValidationError

\* AuthorizationError

\* ExecutionRejectedError



\---



\# 10. TLS



Secure transport SHOULD be enabled by default.



SDKs SHOULD support:



\* certificate validation

\* custom certificate authorities

\* hostname verification



SDKs MUST NOT disable TLS verification by default.



\---



\# 11. Logging



SDKs SHOULD provide configurable logging.



Logging configuration MAY include:



\* log level

\* output destination

\* structured logging

\* request identifiers



Sensitive information MUST NOT be logged.



Examples of sensitive information:



\* API keys

\* bearer tokens

\* passwords

\* private business data

\* cryptographic secrets



\---



\# 12. User Agent



SDKs SHOULD identify themselves when communicating with the Runtime.



Example



```text

Parmana-TypeScript-SDK/1.0.0

```



or



```text

Parmana-Python-SDK/1.0.0

```



The user agent assists with diagnostics and compatibility.



\---



\# 13. Environment Configuration



SDKs SHOULD support loading configuration from application environments.



Typical configuration sources include:



\* constructor parameters

\* environment variables

\* configuration files

\* dependency injection



SDKs MUST define a clear precedence order.



\---



\# 14. Default Configuration



SDKs SHOULD provide safe defaults.



Examples include:



\* secure transport enabled

\* retry disabled or conservative

\* reasonable timeout values

\* minimal logging



Applications may override defaults when necessary.



\---



\# 15. Immutable Configuration



Configuration SHOULD be immutable after the ParmanaClient has been created.



Changing configuration during active operation is discouraged.



Creating a new client instance is preferred.



\---



\# 16. Thread Safety



Configuration objects SHOULD be safe for concurrent read access.



Configuration mutation should not affect active requests.



\---



\# 17. Validation



SDKs MUST validate configuration before establishing communication with the Runtime.



Examples of validation include:



\* valid endpoint

\* supported transport

\* required authentication

\* valid timeout values



Invalid configuration MUST result in a ConfigurationError.



\---



\# 18. Language Mapping



Every official SDK exposes the same conceptual configuration model.



Example



TypeScript



```text

Configuration

```



Python



```text

Configuration

```



The implementation syntax may differ, but the concepts remain identical.



\---



\# 19. Compatibility



New configuration options MAY be introduced in future SDK versions.



Existing configuration behavior MUST remain backward compatible whenever practical.



Breaking configuration changes require a major version increment.



\---



\# 20. Conformance Requirements



An official Parmana SDK MUST:



\* expose a canonical Configuration model

\* support runtime endpoint configuration

\* support authentication configuration

\* support transport configuration

\* support timeout configuration

\* support retry configuration

\* validate configuration before use

\* provide secure defaults

\* preserve language parity



\---



\# Summary



The Parmana SDK Configuration model provides a consistent, secure, and language-independent mechanism for configuring communication between applications and the Parmana Runtime.



By separating communication concerns from runtime behavior, the SDK maintains a stable public interface while allowing the Parmana platform to evolve independently.
