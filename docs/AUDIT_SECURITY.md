\# Security Audit



\*\*Version:\*\* v1 Foundation  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-07-03



\---



\# Purpose



This document audits the security architecture of the Parmana Execution Trust Platform.



The objective is to evaluate how Parmana protects execution evidence, verifies integrity, detects tampering, and establishes trust in enterprise AI execution.



This audit focuses on the current implementation and identifies future security enhancements.



\---



\# Security Objectives



The platform is designed to provide:



\- Execution integrity

\- Cryptographic authenticity

\- Immutable execution evidence

\- Independent verification

\- Deterministic replay

\- Tamper detection

\- Trust preservation



Parmana does \*\*not\*\* currently provide authentication, authorization, or confidentiality. Those capabilities are planned for future releases.

\# Current Security Capabilities



\## Immutable Execution Evidence



Every Business Transaction generates an immutable Execution Trust Record.



Stored evidence includes:



\- Transaction

\- Execution

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Digital Signature

\- Verification History

\- Receipt History



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\## Cryptographic Integrity



Execution Trust Records are protected using:



\- Canonical serialization

\- SHA-256 hashing

\- Ed25519 digital signatures



This allows independent verification that stored evidence has not been modified.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\## Digital Signatures



Every Trust Record is digitally signed.



Signature verification confirms:



\- authenticity

\- integrity

\- tamper detection



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\## Verification



Verification independently validates:



\- Trust Record hash

\- Digital signature



Verification results become immutable execution evidence.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\## Receipt Security



Receipts are generated only after successful verification.



Each Receipt contains:



\- Receipt Hash

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Digital Signature

\- Timestamp



Receipts provide portable cryptographic evidence.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\## Replay Integrity



Replay reconstructs stored execution evidence.



Replay validates:



\- deterministic hash

\- digital signature

\- verification state



Replay detects modification of stored evidence.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Current Threat Coverage



\## Evidence Tampering



Protected.



Any modification changes the SHA-256 hash and invalidates the signature.



\---



\## Record Corruption



Protected.



Replay detects corrupted Trust Records through deterministic verification.



\---



\## Accidental Modification



Protected.



Verification immediately detects changes to immutable evidence.



\---



\## Independent Verification



Supported.



Third parties can independently verify Trust Records using the stored cryptographic evidence.



\---



\# Current Limitations



The current implementation does \*\*not\*\* yet include:



\- User authentication

\- Authorization

\- Multi-factor authentication

\- API key management

\- Session management

\- Tenant isolation

\- Role-based access control

\- Encryption of stored business data

\- Secret rotation

\- Hardware-backed keys



These capabilities are intentionally planned for future enterprise releases.



\---



\# Key Management



Current implementation:



\- File-based key provider

\- Ed25519 key pairs

\- Runtime key loading



Suitable for:



\- development

\- testing

\- self-hosted deployments



Future enterprise implementations should support:



\- Cloud KMS

\- Hardware Security Modules

\- Managed key rotation

\- Key versioning

\- Certificate management



\---



\# Storage Security



Current implementation provides:



\- Immutable Trust Records

\- Persistent execution evidence

\- Cryptographic verification



Future enhancements include:



\- Row-level security

\- Encryption at rest

\- Multi-tenant isolation

\- Backup verification



\---



\# API Security



Current protections:



\- Request validation

\- UUID validation

\- Deterministic processing

\- Runtime error handling



Future enhancements:



\- Authentication

\- Authorization

\- OAuth

\- API keys

\- Rate limiting

\- Request signing

\- Audit logging



\---



\# Cryptographic Algorithms



Current implementation:



| Function | Algorithm |

|----------|-----------|

| Hashing | SHA-256 |

| Digital Signatures | Ed25519 |



Future support:



\- Dilithium

\- Hybrid signatures

\- Algorithm negotiation

\- Post-Quantum Cryptography



\---



\# Security Strengths



\- Immutable execution evidence

\- Deterministic verification

\- Independent replay

\- Canonical serialization

\- Modern digital signatures

\- Repository abstraction

\- Modular crypto providers

\- Cryptographic receipts



\---



\# Planned Enterprise Security



Future releases are expected to include:



\- Human Authority enforcement

\- Policy enforcement

\- Authorization workflows

\- Enterprise Identity integration

\- Role-based access control

\- Key rotation

\- Cloud KMS

\- HSM support

\- Secret management

\- Audit dashboards

\- Security monitoring

\- Compliance reporting

\# Risk Assessment



Current implementation has a strong integrity model.



Remaining risks primarily relate to enterprise operational security rather than execution trust.



Areas requiring future implementation include:



\- Identity management

\- Access control

\- Secret lifecycle management

\- Operational monitoring

\- Infrastructure hardening



These do not reduce the correctness of the current Execution Trust implementation but are necessary for enterprise production deployments.



\---



\# Conclusion



The Parmana v1 Foundation provides a strong security model centered on execution integrity rather than perimeter security.



The platform successfully delivers:



\- immutable execution evidence

\- cryptographic integrity

\- digital signatures

\- deterministic verification

\- signed receipts

\- replay validation



These capabilities establish a trusted foundation for enterprise AI execution. Future releases will extend this foundation with authentication, authorization, governance, and enterprise security controls.
