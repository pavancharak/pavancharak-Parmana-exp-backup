\# Parmana Platform Audit



\*\*Version:\*\* v1 Foundation  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-07-03



\---



\# Executive Summary



Parmana is an Execution Trust Infrastructure for Enterprise AI.



It provides a deterministic trust layer between AI systems and enterprise execution systems by ensuring that every executed business transaction is recorded, cryptographically protected, independently verifiable, and replayable.



The current implementation successfully delivers the complete Execution Trust lifecycle, including execution, immutable trust record creation, verification, receipt generation, and deterministic replay.



The platform establishes a production-ready technical foundation upon which enterprise authorization, policy enforcement, and governance capabilities can be built.



\---



\# Platform Objective



Parmana enables organizations to trust AI execution by providing verifiable evidence for every high-impact action.



Instead of trusting AI assertions, organizations can independently verify that an executed action:



\- was recorded,

\- remained unmodified,

\- was cryptographically protected,

\- can be replayed deterministically,

\- and produces verifiable execution evidence.



\---



\# Completed Capabilities



\## Execution Runtime



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



Implemented capabilities:



\- Business Transaction execution

\- Decision generation

\- Execution recording

\- Runtime orchestration



\---



\## Execution Trust Record



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



Every execution produces an immutable Execution Trust Record containing:



\- Business Transaction

\- Execution

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Digital Signature

\- Verification history

\- Receipt history

\- Override history



\---



\## Verification



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



Implemented:



\- Trust Record reconstruction

\- Deterministic hash validation

\- Digital signature verification

\- Verification persistence



Verification results become part of the immutable trust history.



\---



\## Receipt Generation



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



Receipts are generated only after successful verification.



Each receipt includes:



\- Receipt ID

\- Receipt Hash

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Digital Signature

\- Timestamp



Receipts are permanently stored.



\---



\## Deterministic Replay



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



Previously executed Business Transactions can be replayed.



Replay validates:



\- Trust Record integrity

\- Hash consistency

\- Digital signature

\- Verification status



Replay produces deterministic verification results.



\---



\## Cryptography



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



Implemented cryptographic primitives:



\- Canonical serialization

\- SHA-256 hashing

\- Ed25519 digital signatures



The cryptographic implementation provides deterministic integrity verification for Execution Trust Records and Receipts.



\---



\## Persistence



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



Execution evidence is persisted using Supabase.



Stored artifacts include:



\- Execution Trust Records

\- Executions

\- Overrides

\- Verifications

\- Receipts



Repository reconstruction successfully rebuilds complete aggregates from persistent storage.



\---



\## REST API



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



Available endpoints:



```

POST /execute



POST /verify



POST /receipt



POST /replay

```



These endpoints implement the complete Execution Trust lifecycle.



\---



\## Integration Testing



\*\*Status:\*\* Complete



The platform includes end-to-end integration tests validating:



\- Execution

\- Verification

\- Receipt generation

\- Replay

\- Cryptographic verification

\- Storage persistence



\---



\# Platform Architecture



Current architecture follows a layered design.

\# Conclusion



Parmana has successfully completed the foundational Execution Trust platform.



The current implementation demonstrates that enterprise AI actions can be:



\- executed,

\- recorded,

\- cryptographically protected,

\- independently verified,

\- issued with signed receipts,

\- and deterministically replayed.



This foundation enables future enterprise capabilities such as authorization, policy enforcement, governance, and compliance without requiring architectural redesign.
