\# Parmana API Specification



Version: 1.0



Status: Normative



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the logical API surface of the Parmana Execution Trust Infrastructure.



The API exposes the capabilities required to:



\* execute Business Transactions

\* verify execution evidence

\* replay historical execution

\* retrieve execution artifacts



The specification is transport-independent.



REST, gRPC, SDK, and CLI implementations may expose different interfaces while preserving the same semantics.



\---



\# API Principles



The Parmana API is designed around trust artifacts rather than runtime operations.



Every request is expected to preserve the execution trust chain.



The API SHALL:



\* validate inputs

\* preserve deterministic behavior

\* produce immutable execution evidence

\* support independent verification



\---

\# Operations



\## Execute



Processes a Business Transaction.



\### Input



BusinessTransaction



\### Processing



\* Validate Business Transaction

\* Load referenced Policy

\* Evaluate Policy

\* Produce Decision

\* Execute Runtime

\* Produce Execution Trust Record

\* Produce Receipt



\### Output



```text

ExecutionResult



\- Decision

\- Execution

\- Execution Trust Record

\- Receipt

```



\---



\## Verify



Verifies execution evidence.



\### Input



Execution Trust Record



Receipt



\### Processing



\* Verify hashes

\* Verify signatures

\* Verify integrity



\### Output



```text

VerificationResult



\- valid

\- verification details

```



\---



\## Replay



Replays historical execution.



\### Input



Execution Trust Record



\### Processing



\* Load recorded execution

\* Re-evaluate

\* Compare results

\* Report differences



\### Output



```text

ReplayResult



\- replay decision

\- comparison

\- detected differences

```



\---



\## Retrieve



Retrieves historical execution artifacts.



Examples:



\* Business Transaction

\* Decision

\* Execution

\* Execution Trust Record

\* Receipt



\---



\# Request Lifecycle



Every Execute request follows the same lifecycle.



```text

Request

&#x20;   ↓

Business Transaction Validation

&#x20;   ↓

Policy Selection

&#x20;   ↓

Policy Validation

&#x20;   ↓

Policy Evaluation

&#x20;   ↓

Decision

&#x20;   ↓

Runtime Execution

&#x20;   ↓

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;   ↓

Receipt

&#x20;   ↓

Response

```



\---



\# Execution Guarantees



The Execute operation SHALL:



\* validate Business Transactions

\* execute exactly one referenced Policy

\* produce one Decision

\* produce one Execution

\* produce one Execution Trust Record

\* produce one Receipt



Execution SHALL fail when required trust artifacts are missing.



\---



\# Verification Guarantees



Verification SHALL:



\* validate execution integrity

\* verify cryptographic evidence

\* preserve immutable execution artifacts



Verification SHALL NOT modify execution evidence.



\---



\# Replay Guarantees



Replay SHALL:



\* preserve historical evidence

\* compare recorded and replayed execution

\* report detected differences



Replay SHALL NOT modify historical execution records.



\---



\# Error Model



Implementations SHOULD return structured errors.



Examples include:



```text

VALIDATION\_ERROR



POLICY\_NOT\_FOUND



POLICY\_VERSION\_MISMATCH



POLICY\_VALIDATION\_ERROR



UNAUTHORIZED\_EXECUTION



DECISION\_REQUIRED



VERIFICATION\_FAILED



REPLAY\_FAILED

```



Error identifiers SHOULD remain stable across implementations.



\---



\# Security Requirements



API implementations SHOULD:



\* validate all inputs

\* reject malformed Business Transactions

\* verify policy identity before evaluation

\* protect cryptographic material

\* validate execution evidence before verification



Authentication and authorization mechanisms are deployment-specific and outside the scope of this specification.



\---



\# Transport Independence



This specification does not mandate:



\* HTTP

\* REST

\* gRPC

\* GraphQL

\* CLI

\* SDK



Any transport MAY be used provided the execution semantics defined by this specification are preserved.



\---



\# Conformance



An API implementation conforms when it:



\* preserves the canonical execution trust chain

\* satisfies the Parmana Specification

\* satisfies the Parmana Guarantees

\* passes the Parmana Conformance Suite

\# Guiding Principle



The Parmana API is not simply an interface to a runtime.



It is the public entry point into the Execution Trust Infrastructure, preserving the integrity of the trust chain from Business Transaction to independently verifiable execution evidence.
