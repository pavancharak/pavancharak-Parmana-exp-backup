\# RFC-0008: Generic Policy Runtime Architecture



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\## Purpose



This RFC defines the canonical architecture of the Parmana Policy Runtime.



The runtime is responsible for loading, validating, and executing the exact policy referenced by a BusinessTransaction. It is deterministic, domain-independent, and does not contain business-specific logic.



This RFC complements RFC-0007 (Canonical Trust Chain Domain Model) by defining the runtime responsibilities for policy execution.



\---



\# Goals



The Policy Runtime SHALL:



\* Execute exactly one policy.

\* Never infer or discover which policy applies.

\* Be deterministic.

\* Be domain independent.

\* Support arbitrary business domains.

\* Support future policy schema evolution.

\* Produce verifiable execution evidence.



\---



\# Architecture



```text

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyReference

(name, version, schemaVersion)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyRegistry

(metadata only)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyRouter

(load exact artifact)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyAdapter

(RuntimeTransaction → PolicySignals)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyEngine

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Decision

```



\---



\# Policy Reference



Every BusinessTransaction SHALL contain exactly one PolicyReference.



```ts

interface PolicyReference {

&#x20;   readonly name: string;

&#x20;   readonly version: string;

&#x20;   readonly schemaVersion: string;

}

```



The PolicyReference uniquely identifies the policy artifact to execute.



\---



\# Policy Artifact



Every policy artifact SHALL declare:



```json

{

&#x20; "policyId": "vendor-payment",

&#x20; "policyVersion": "1.0.0",

&#x20; "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",



&#x20; "signalsSchema": {

&#x20;   "amount": "number",

&#x20;   "currency": "string",

&#x20;   "vendorVerified": "boolean"

&#x20; },



&#x20; "rules": \[

&#x20;   ...

&#x20; ]

}

```



The runtime SHALL validate:



\* policyId

\* policyVersion

\* schemaVersion



before execution.



\---



\# Runtime Transaction



The runtime SHALL remain domain independent.



```ts

interface RuntimeTransaction {

&#x20;   readonly signals: Record<string, JsonValue>;

}

```



The runtime SHALL NOT contain payment-specific, healthcare-specific, or any other business-specific fields.



\---



\# Policy Signals



The Policy Engine evaluates generic runtime signals.



```ts

interface PolicySignals {

&#x20;   \[key: string]: JsonValue;

}



type PolicyInput = PolicySignals;

```



Signals are supplied by the runtime and interpreted by the policy.



\---



\# Policy Adapter



The PolicyAdapter converts a RuntimeTransaction into the PolicyInput consumed by the PolicyEngine.



```text

RuntimeTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyAdapter

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicySignals

```



The adapter SHALL NOT contain domain-specific mapping logic.



\---



\# Policy Registry



The PolicyRegistry manages policy metadata.



Responsibilities:



\* register policy metadata

\* list policies

\* resolve policy metadata



The PolicyRegistry SHALL NOT execute policies.



\---



\# Policy Router



The PolicyRouter loads the exact policy artifact referenced by the BusinessTransaction.



Responsibilities:



\* locate policy artifact

\* load policy JSON

\* validate identifier

\* validate business version

\* validate schema version



The PolicyRouter SHALL NOT:



\* scan policies to determine applicability

\* evaluate business rules

\* choose among multiple policies



Policy selection occurs before runtime execution.



\---



\# Policy Engine



The PolicyEngine evaluates exactly one loaded policy.



Responsibilities:



\* evaluate rules deterministically

\* produce a Decision

\* record evaluation trace



The PolicyEngine SHALL NOT:



\* load policies

\* discover policies

\* modify runtime state



\---



\# Domain Independence



The runtime supports any policy domain.



Examples:



Payment



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "amount": 5000,

&#x20;   "currency": "USD"

&#x20; }

}

```



Loan



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "creditScore": 780,

&#x20;   "income": 120000

&#x20; }

}

```



Healthcare



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "patientAge": 67,

&#x20;   "diagnosis": "Diabetes"

&#x20; }

}

```



Cybersecurity



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "riskScore": 91,

&#x20;   "deviceTrusted": true

&#x20; }

}

```



No runtime code changes are required to support new domains.



\---



\# Determinism



For identical:



\* PolicyReference

\* Policy Artifact

\* Runtime Signals



the PolicyEngine SHALL always produce the same Decision.



Determinism is a fundamental invariant of Parmana.

\# Separation of Responsibilities



| Component           | Responsibility                            |

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| BusinessTransaction | References the policy                     |

| PolicyReference     | Identifies the exact policy               |

| PolicyRegistry      | Maintains policy metadata                 |

| PolicyRouter        | Loads the exact policy artifact           |

| PolicyAdapter       | Converts runtime data into policy signals |

| PolicyEngine        | Evaluates one policy                      |

| Decision            | Records evaluation result                 |



No component performs another component's responsibility.



\---



\# Architectural Invariants



\* Exactly one policy SHALL be executed.

\* Runtime SHALL NOT guess the applicable policy.

\* Runtime SHALL NOT scan all policies.

\* Policy loading SHALL be deterministic.

\* Policy execution SHALL be deterministic.

\* Business logic SHALL reside in policy artifacts.

\* Runtime SHALL remain domain independent.

\* New policy domains SHALL require no runtime code changes.



\---



\# Relationship to RFC-0007



RFC-0007 defines the canonical trust-chain domain model.



RFC-0008 defines how the runtime executes the PolicyReference contained within the BusinessTransaction while preserving determinism and execution trust.



\---



\# Status



This document defines the canonical Generic Policy Runtime Architecture for Parmana Phase 1.
