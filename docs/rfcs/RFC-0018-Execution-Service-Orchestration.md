\# RFC-0018: Execution Service Orchestration



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\## Purpose



This RFC defines the canonical responsibilities of the `ExecutionService` within the Parmana Runtime.



With the domain model, policy runtime, `DecisionService`, and `ExecutionTrustRecordService` established, the `ExecutionService` becomes the orchestration layer that coordinates execution without containing business logic.



\---



\# Objectives



The `ExecutionService` SHALL:



\* orchestrate the end-to-end execution workflow

\* invoke runtime services in the correct order

\* coordinate artifact creation

\* manage execution lifecycle

\* terminate execution on unrecoverable validation failures



The `ExecutionService` SHALL NOT:



\* evaluate policy rules

\* construct Decisions

\* construct ExecutionTrustRecords

\* generate Receipts

\* perform Verification

\* contain business-specific logic

\# ExecutionService Responsibilities



The `ExecutionService` SHALL orchestrate the following components:



```text

ExecutionService

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ├── PolicyRouter

&#x20;     ├── PolicyValidator

&#x20;     ├── PolicyAdapter

&#x20;     ├── SignalValidator

&#x20;     ├── PolicyEngine

&#x20;     ├── DecisionService

&#x20;     ├── ExecutionTrustRecordService

&#x20;     ├── ReceiptService

&#x20;     └── VerificationService

```



The `ExecutionService` SHALL coordinate these components but SHALL NOT implement their internal responsibilities.



\---



\# Runtime Service Responsibilities



| Service                     | Responsibility                                |

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |

| BusinessTransactionService  | Construct BusinessTransaction                 |

| ExecutionService            | Orchestrate execution workflow                |

| PolicyRouter                | Load policy artifact                          |

| PolicyValidator             | Validate policy artifact                      |

| PolicyAdapter               | Convert RuntimeTransaction into PolicySignals |

| SignalValidator             | Validate runtime signals                      |

| PolicyEngine                | Evaluate deterministic policy rules           |

| DecisionService             | Construct immutable Decision                  |

| ExecutionTrustRecordService | Construct immutable ExecutionTrustRecord      |

| ReceiptService              | Generate cryptographic Receipt                |

| VerificationService         | Verify execution artifacts                    |



Every runtime service SHALL own exactly one responsibility.



\---



\# Execution Flow



The `ExecutionService` SHALL execute the following sequence:



1\. Receive a validated `BusinessTransaction`.

2\. Resolve the referenced policy.

3\. Load the policy artifact.

4\. Validate the policy artifact.

5\. Convert the runtime transaction into `PolicySignals`.

6\. Validate the runtime signals.

7\. Evaluate the policy.

8\. Construct the immutable `Decision`.

9\. Create the `Execution`.

10\. Construct the immutable `ExecutionTrustRecord`.

11\. Generate the cryptographic `Receipt`.

12\. Perform verification.

13\. Return the completed execution result.



Execution SHALL terminate immediately if any mandatory validation step fails.



\---



\# Architectural Invariants



The runtime SHALL satisfy the following invariants:



1\. `ExecutionService` SHALL act only as an orchestrator.

2\. Policy evaluation SHALL occur only in the `PolicyEngine`.

3\. Decision construction SHALL occur only in the `DecisionService`.

4\. ExecutionTrustRecord construction SHALL occur only in the `ExecutionTrustRecordService`.

5\. Receipt generation SHALL occur only in the `ReceiptService`.

6\. Verification SHALL occur only in the `VerificationService`.

7\. Runtime SHALL remain deterministic.

8\. Runtime SHALL remain domain independent.

9\. Business logic SHALL reside exclusively in policy artifacts.

10\. Identical validated inputs SHALL produce identical Decisions.



\---



\# Remaining Phase 1 Implementation



The remaining implementation work SHALL proceed in the following order:



1\. Refactor `ExecutionService` into a pure orchestrator.

2\. Refactor `ReceiptService` to operate on `ExecutionTrustRecord`.

3\. Refactor `VerificationService` to verify immutable execution artifacts.

4\. Complete replay integration.

5\. Complete persistence integration.

6\. Complete end-to-end integration tests.

7\. Validate persistence, replay, receipt generation, cryptographic integrity, and verification.



\---



\# Phase 1 Milestone



With the implementation of:



\* DecisionService

\* ExecutionTrustRecordService



the project has transitioned from architectural definition to execution pipeline integration.



The remaining work focuses on wiring the existing components into a complete, deterministic execution workflow without changing the established architecture.



\---



\# Status



This RFC locks the orchestration responsibilities of the `ExecutionService` for Parmana Phase 1.



Future implementations SHALL preserve the orchestration model and the single-responsibility design established by the runtime service architecture.
