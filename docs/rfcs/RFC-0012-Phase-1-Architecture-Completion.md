\# RFC-0012: Phase 1 Architecture Completion



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\## Purpose



This RFC records the successful completion of Phase 1 of the Parmana architecture.



Phase 1 establishes the canonical execution trust foundation upon which all future capabilities will be built.



The objective of Phase 1 was to transform the runtime from a payment-oriented implementation into a deterministic, policy-driven, domain-independent execution platform.



\---



\# Phase 1 Objectives



Phase 1 established the following architectural principles:



\* deterministic execution

\* policy-driven execution

\* domain independence

\* immutable policy artifacts

\* execution trust

\* replayability

\* independent verification



\---



\# Locked Architecture



\## PolicyReference



The canonical PolicyReference is:



```ts

interface PolicyReference {

&#x20;   readonly name: string;

&#x20;   readonly version: string;

&#x20;   readonly schemaVersion: string;

}

```



The PolicyReference uniquely identifies the policy artifact.



It forms part of the execution trust chain.



\---



\## PolicyRouter



The PolicyRouter is responsible for loading exactly one policy artifact.



Responsibilities:



\* load referenced policy

\* validate policy identity

\* validate policy version

\* validate schema version



The PolicyRouter SHALL NOT:



\* scan policy directories

\* discover policies

\* infer applicability

\* evaluate business rules

\* choose between policies



\---



\## Policy



The canonical policy artifact contains:



```ts

interface Policy {

&#x20;   policyId: string;

&#x20;   policyVersion: string;

&#x20;   schemaVersion: string;

&#x20;   signalsSchema: Record<string, string>;

&#x20;   rules: PolicyRule\[];

}

```



Policy artifacts are immutable after publication.



\---



\## PolicyEngine



The PolicyEngine is generic.



Responsibilities:



\* deterministic evaluation

\* rule execution

\* decision generation



The PolicyEngine contains no business-specific logic.



\---



\## PolicyAdapter



The PolicyAdapter converts runtime data into policy signals.



```text

RuntimeTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicySignals

```



The adapter is domain independent.



It performs no business-specific transformation.



\---



\## RuntimeTransaction



The canonical RuntimeTransaction is:



```ts

interface RuntimeTransaction {

&#x20;   readonly signals: Record<string, JsonValue>;

}

```



The runtime no longer contains fields such as:



\* amount

\* currency

\* recipient



Business-specific information is represented entirely as runtime signals.



\---



\# Domain Independence



The runtime supports any business domain.



Examples include:



\## Payment



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "amount": 5000,

&#x20;   "currency": "USD"

&#x20; }

}

```



\## Lending



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "creditScore": 760,

&#x20;   "income": 90000

&#x20; }

}

```



\## Healthcare



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "patientAge": 67,

&#x20;   "diagnosis": "Diabetes"

&#x20; }

}

```



\## Cybersecurity



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "riskScore": 82,

&#x20;   "deviceTrusted": true

&#x20; }

}

```



\## Manufacturing



```json

{

&#x20; "signals": {

&#x20;   "temperature": 72,

&#x20;   "pressure": 125

&#x20; }

}

```



The runtime requires no code changes to support additional domains.



\---



\# Architectural Achievements



Phase 1 establishes:



\* Generic policy evaluation

\* Unlimited runtime signals

\* Policy schema awareness

\* Policy version awareness

\* Deterministic execution

\* Replayable execution

\* Independently verifiable execution

\* Clear separation of responsibilities



\---



\# Remaining Phase 1 Milestone



One architectural refinement remains.



The runtime currently contains residual policy-selection behavior.



The final step is to eliminate all policy-selection logic.



The runtime SHALL execute only the policy explicitly referenced by the BusinessTransaction.



\---



\# Target Execution Flow



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyReference

(name, version, schemaVersion)

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyRegistry

(metadata only)

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyRouter

(load exact artifact)

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyEngine

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Decision

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

TrustRecord

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Receipt

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Independent Verification

```



Once the PolicyRouter loads only the explicitly referenced policy, the runtime becomes a pure execution engine.



\---



\# Phase 1 Completion Criteria



Phase 1 is considered complete when all of the following conditions are satisfied:



\* BusinessTransaction references exactly one PolicyReference.

\* PolicyReference contains `name`, `version`, and `schemaVersion`.

\* PolicyRegistry manages metadata only.

\* PolicyRouter loads exactly one policy artifact.

\* PolicyRouter performs no policy discovery.

\* PolicyEngine evaluates exactly one loaded policy.

\* Runtime contains no policy-selection logic.

\* Policy artifacts are immutable.

\* Execution is deterministic.

\* Replay reproduces the original decision.

\* Verification independently validates the execution.



\---



\# Foundation for Future Phases



Phase 1 provides the foundation for:



\* richer policy language features

\* additional condition operators

\* policy schema evolution

\* advanced policy tooling

\* policy authoring environments

\* policy registries

\* distributed policy repositories

\* execution governance

\* cryptographic policy attestations



None of these future capabilities require changes to the core execution architecture established in Phase 1.



\---



\# Status



This RFC records the completion of the Phase 1 architectural foundation for Parmana.



The runtime is now a generic, deterministic, policy-driven execution platform capable of supporting any business domain while preserving execution trust, replayability, and independent verification.
