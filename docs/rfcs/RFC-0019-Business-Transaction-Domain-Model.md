\# RFC-0019: Business Transaction Domain Model



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\## Purpose



This RFC defines the canonical `BusinessTransaction` domain model within the Parmana Execution Trust Architecture.



The `BusinessTransaction` represents the immutable business context submitted for execution. It captures everything required to deterministically evaluate a policy, but it does not contain the results of that evaluation.



\---



\# Architectural Position



The `BusinessTransaction` is an input artifact.



It exists before policy evaluation and therefore SHALL NOT contain execution artifacts produced later in the trust chain.



The canonical execution flow is:



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyReference

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyEngine

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Decision

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

ExecutionTrustRecord

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Receipt

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

```



\---



\# Responsibilities



The `BusinessTransaction` SHALL:



\* identify the business transaction

\* capture the complete upstream trust chain

\* specify the exact policy to execute

\* carry the runtime signals required for evaluation

\* remain immutable after creation



The `BusinessTransaction` SHALL NOT:



\* contain a `Decision`

\* contain execution state

\* contain receipt information

\* contain verification results

\* contain execution evidence



\---



\# Canonical Structure



The canonical `BusinessTransaction` SHALL contain:



```text

BusinessTransaction

├── businessTransactionId

├── metadata

├── authority

├── authorization

├── intent

├── policy : PolicyReference

├── signals

├── status

└── createdAt

```



\---



\# Policy Reference



Every `BusinessTransaction` SHALL contain exactly one `PolicyReference`.



The `PolicyReference` SHALL include:



```text

PolicyReference

├── name

├── version

└── schemaVersion

```



The `PolicyReference` forms part of the cryptographically verifiable execution trust chain.



\---



\# Runtime Signals



Runtime signals are opaque business facts supplied at execution time.



Examples include:



Payment



```json

{

&#x20; "amount": 5000,

&#x20; "currency": "USD"

}

```



Loan



```json

{

&#x20; "creditScore": 760,

&#x20; "income": 90000

}

```



Healthcare



```json

{

&#x20; "patientAge": 67,

&#x20; "diagnosis": "Diabetes"

}

```



Cybersecurity



```json

{

&#x20; "riskScore": 82,

&#x20; "deviceTrusted": true

}

```



Manufacturing



```json

{

&#x20; "temperature": 72,

&#x20; "pressure": 125

}

```



Parmana assigns no business meaning to these values.



Their interpretation belongs entirely to the referenced policy.



\---



\# Decision Separation



A `Decision` SHALL NOT be embedded within a `BusinessTransaction`.



The `Decision` is produced only after deterministic policy evaluation.



```text

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyEngine

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Decision

```



This preserves the causal relationship between inputs and outputs.



\---



\# Architectural Invariants



The `BusinessTransaction` SHALL satisfy the following invariants:



1\. It SHALL be immutable.

2\. It SHALL represent only execution inputs.

3\. It SHALL contain exactly one `PolicyReference`.

4\. It SHALL contain the runtime signals required for policy evaluation.

5\. It SHALL NOT contain execution artifacts.

6\. It SHALL NOT contain a `Decision`.

7\. It SHALL remain domain independent.

8\. Identical `BusinessTransaction` instances SHALL produce identical policy evaluation inputs.



\---



\# Relationship to Other Domain Objects



The trust chain is defined as:



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Decision

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

ExecutionTrustRecord

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Receipt

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

```



Each domain object represents a distinct stage in the execution lifecycle and owns only the data created at that stage.



\---



\# Benefits



Separating the `BusinessTransaction` from the `Decision` provides:



\* clear separation of inputs and outputs

\* deterministic policy evaluation

\* domain independence

\* replayability

\* immutable execution artifacts

\* independently verifiable execution

\* a clean execution trust chain



\---



\# Status



This RFC locks the canonical `BusinessTransaction` domain model for Parmana.



The `BusinessTransaction` SHALL remain an immutable execution input and SHALL NOT embed downstream execution artifacts such as `Decision`, `Execution`, `Receipt`, or `Verification`.
