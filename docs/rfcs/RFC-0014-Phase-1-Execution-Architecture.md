\# RFC-0014: Phase 1 Execution Architecture



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\## Purpose



This RFC records the completion of the Phase 1 execution architecture for Parmana.



Phase 1 establishes the canonical execution trust model, deterministic policy execution pipeline, and domain model that all future implementations SHALL follow.



This RFC serves as the architectural baseline for implementation.



\---



\# Phase 1 Goals



Phase 1 establishes:



\* Deterministic execution

\* Domain-independent policy evaluation

\* Immutable execution artifacts

\* Replayability

\* Independent verification

\* Cryptographically verifiable execution evidence



\---



\# Canonical Trust Chain



The canonical trust chain is:



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyReference

(name, version, schemaVersion)

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Policy

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Decision

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

ExecutionTrustRecord

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Receipt

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

```



Each artifact is immutable.



Each artifact extends the trust chain.

\# Canonical Policy Execution Pipeline



```text

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyReference

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyRegistry

(metadata)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyRouter

(load policy artifact)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyValidator

(validate artifact)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyAdapter

(RuntimeTransaction → PolicySignals)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

SignalValidator

(validate runtime signals)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyEngine

(evaluate)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Decision

```



The runtime executes exactly one policy.



\---



\# Domain Model



\## Authority



Defines who is permitted to authorize actions.



\---



\## Authorization



Records approval granted by an authority.



\---



\## Intent



Represents the desired business outcome.



\---



\## BusinessTransaction



Represents an execution request.



It contains exactly one:



```text

PolicyReference

```



\---



\## PolicyReference



```ts

interface PolicyReference {

&#x20;   readonly name: string;

&#x20;   readonly version: string;

&#x20;   readonly schemaVersion: string;

}

```



It uniquely identifies the policy artifact.



\---



\## Policy



Every policy declares:



```text

policyId

policyVersion

schemaVersion

signalsSchema

rules

```



Policy artifacts are immutable.



\---



\## Decision



The deterministic result of evaluating a policy against validated runtime signals.



A Decision binds together:



\* Intent

\* PolicyReference

\* Runtime signals

\* Outcome

\* Reason

\* Evaluation timestamp



\---



\## Execution



Records the lifecycle of processing a BusinessTransaction.



Execution captures:



\* lifecycle state

\* execution mode

\* timestamps

\* execution evidence

\* execution metadata



Execution is immutable.



\---



\## ExecutionTrustRecord



The canonical aggregate.



It contains:



\* BusinessTransaction

\* Executions

\* Overrides

\* Verifications

\* Receipts

\* TrustRecordHash



It is the authoritative source for replay, audit, receipt generation, and verification.



\---



\## Receipt



Cryptographically signed proof of the ExecutionTrustRecord state.



Receipts are immutable.



\---



\## Verification



Records the independent verification of an ExecutionTrustRecord.



Each verification is immutable.



\---



\# Runtime Components



\## PolicyRegistry



Maintains policy metadata.



\---



\## PolicyRouter



Loads the exact policy artifact identified by the PolicyReference.



The router SHALL NOT:



\* discover policies

\* infer applicability

\* evaluate business logic



\---



\## PolicyValidator



Validates:



\* policyId

\* policyVersion

\* schemaVersion

\* signalsSchema

\* rule structure



\---



\## PolicyAdapter



Converts RuntimeTransaction into generic PolicySignals.



The adapter contains no business-specific logic.



\---



\## SignalValidator



Validates runtime signals against the policy's declared signalsSchema.



Execution SHALL fail if validation fails.



\---



\## PolicyEngine



Evaluates exactly one loaded policy.



The engine is deterministic and domain independent.



\---



\# Architectural Invariants



The runtime SHALL satisfy the following invariants:



1\. Exactly one policy is executed.

2\. BusinessTransaction contains exactly one PolicyReference.

3\. Policy artifacts are immutable.

4\. Runtime never discovers policies.

5\. Runtime never guesses policies.

6\. Policy evaluation is deterministic.

7\. Runtime signals are validated before evaluation.

8\. Business logic resides exclusively in policy artifacts.

9\. Runtime remains domain independent.

10\. Identical inputs SHALL produce identical decisions.



\---



\# Phase 1 Deliverables



The following architectural components are complete:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* BusinessTransaction

\* PolicyReference

\* Policy

\* PolicyRegistry

\* PolicyRouter

\* PolicyValidator

\* PolicyAdapter

\* SignalValidator

\* PolicyEngine

\* Decision

\* Execution

\* ExecutionTrustRecord

\* Receipt

\* Verification



\---



\# Remaining Implementation Work



The remaining work focuses on implementation rather than architectural redesign.



Priority order:



1\. DecisionService

2\. ExecutionTrustRecordService

3\. ReceiptService

4\. ReplayService completion

5\. VerificationService completion

6\. End-to-end integration tests

7\. Performance optimization



These components SHALL implement the architecture defined in this RFC without altering the canonical domain model.

\# Status



This RFC locks the Phase 1 execution architecture for Parmana.



Future work SHALL extend this architecture without changing the core execution trust model, deterministic policy pipeline, or canonical domain model established in Phase 1.
