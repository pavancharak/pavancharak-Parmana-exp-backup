\# RFC-0013: Policy Execution Pipeline



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\## Purpose



This RFC defines the canonical Policy Execution Pipeline for Parmana.



It specifies how a BusinessTransaction progresses from a policy reference to a deterministic Decision while preserving execution trust.



This pipeline separates policy loading, validation, signal preparation, signal validation, and policy evaluation into independent responsibilities.



\---



\# Objectives



The Policy Execution Pipeline SHALL:



\* execute exactly one policy

\* remain deterministic

\* remain domain independent

\* validate policy artifacts before execution

\* validate runtime signals before evaluation

\* produce a deterministic Decision



\---

(name, version, schemaVersion)

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

PolicyRegistry

(metadata only)

&#x20;       ▼

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

(RuntimeTransaction → PolicySignals)

&#x20;       ▼

SignalValidator

(validate PolicySignals)

&#x20;       ▼

Decision

```



Each component owns exactly one responsibility.



\---



\# Component Responsibilities



\## BusinessTransaction



Provides:



\* execution request

\* PolicyReference

\* runtime data



The BusinessTransaction SHALL NOT contain policy logic.



\---



\## PolicyReference



Identifies the exact policy artifact.



```ts

interface PolicyReference {

&#x20;   readonly name: string;

&#x20;   readonly version: string;

&#x20;   readonly schemaVersion: string;

}

```



\---



\## PolicyRegistry



Responsibilities:



\* register policy metadata

\* resolve metadata

\* list available policies



The registry SHALL NOT execute policies.



\---



\## PolicyRouter



Responsibilities:



\* locate policy artifact

\* load policy.json



The router SHALL NOT:



\* evaluate policies

\* validate policies

\* discover policies

\* apply business logic



\---



\## PolicyValidator



Responsibilities:



Validate:



\* policyId

\* policyVersion

\* schemaVersion

\* signalsSchema

\* rule structure



Execution SHALL fail if validation fails.



\---



\## PolicyAdapter



Responsibilities:



Convert RuntimeTransaction into PolicySignals.



The adapter SHALL remain business-domain independent.



\---



\## SignalValidator



Responsibilities:



Validate runtime signals against the policy's declared signalsSchema.



Validation includes:



\* required signals

\* signal types



Execution SHALL fail on validation errors.



\---



\## PolicyEngine



Responsibilities:



\* evaluate one policy

\* produce one Decision

\* record evaluation trace



The PolicyEngine SHALL NOT:



\* load policies

\* validate policy artifacts

\* validate runtime signals



\---



\# Decision



The Decision is the deterministic result of policy evaluation.



A Decision is derived solely from:



\* PolicyReference

\* policy artifact

\* validated PolicySignals



No external runtime state may influence the result.



\---



\# Determinism



Given identical:



\* BusinessTransaction

\* PolicyReference

\* policy artifact

\* PolicySignals



the Policy Execution Pipeline SHALL always produce the same Decision.



\---



\# Failure Conditions



Execution SHALL terminate if:



\* PolicyReference is invalid.

\* Policy artifact cannot be loaded.

\* Policy validation fails.

\* Signal validation fails.

\* Policy evaluation fails.



No fallback execution is permitted.



\---



\# Architectural Invariants



The pipeline SHALL satisfy the following invariants:



1\. Exactly one policy is executed.

2\. Policy artifacts are validated before execution.

3\. Runtime signals are validated before evaluation.

4\. Policy evaluation is deterministic.

5\. Every component has a single responsibility.

6\. Business logic resides exclusively in policy artifacts.

7\. The runtime remains domain independent.



\---



\# Relationship to the Trust Chain



This RFC covers the transition from:



```text

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Decision

```



The Decision becomes the canonical input for the remaining execution trust chain:



```text

Decision

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

TrustRecord

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Receipt

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Independent Verification

```



\---



\# Phase 1 Completion



The Policy Execution Pipeline is considered complete when:



\* Policy loading is deterministic.

\* Policy validation is complete.

\* Runtime signal validation is complete.

\* Policy evaluation is deterministic.

\* A canonical Decision is produced.



This completes the policy execution stage of the Parmana Execution Trust Architecture.



\---



\# Status



This RFC defines the canonical Policy Execution Pipeline for Parmana Phase 1 and serves as the implementation contract for all future runtime implementations.
