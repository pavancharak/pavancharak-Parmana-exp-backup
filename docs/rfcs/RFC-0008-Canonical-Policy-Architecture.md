\# RFC-0008: Canonical Policy Architecture



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\## Purpose



This RFC defines the canonical policy architecture for Parmana.



The goal is to ensure that policy selection is deterministic, auditable, and forms part of the Execution Trust Chain.



\---



\# Problem



A runtime must never infer which policy applies by scanning all available policies.



Policy selection is an authorization decision, not a runtime decision.



Allowing the runtime to discover or choose policies would make execution dependent on runtime state rather than the trusted execution request.



\---



\# Canonical Architecture



```

Authority

&#x20;   ↓

Authorization

&#x20;   ↓

Intent

&#x20;   ↓

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;   ↓

PolicyReference

&#x20;   ↓

PolicyRouter

&#x20;   ↓

PolicyRegistry

&#x20;   ↓

PolicyEngine

&#x20;   ↓

&#x20;   ↓

Execution

```



\---



\# BusinessTransaction



The BusinessTransaction explicitly specifies the PolicyReference.



Example:



```typescript

policy: {

&#x20;   name: "vendor-payment",

&#x20;   version: "1.0.0"

}

```



The PolicyReference is part of the cryptographically verifiable execution trust chain.



\---



\# PolicyRouter



PolicyRouter has a single responsibility.



It loads the requested versioned policy from storage.



Example:



```

load(policyId, version)

```



PolicyRouter MUST NOT:



\* discover policies

\* evaluate policies

\* determine which policy applies

\* scan every policy on disk



\---



\# PolicyRegistry



PolicyRegistry maintains metadata describing available policies.



Responsibilities include:



\* registering policies

\* version lookup

\* metadata lookup

\* latest-version resolution



PolicyRegistry does not evaluate policies.



\---



\# PolicyEngine



PolicyEngine evaluates exactly one loaded policy.



Inputs:



\* Policy

\* Signals



Outputs:



\* Decision



PolicyEngine must remain deterministic.



\---



\# Runtime



Runtime must never guess which policy applies.



Runtime receives the PolicyReference from the BusinessTransaction and passes it unchanged through the execution pipeline.



\---



\# Trust Chain



The policy is part of the execution trust chain.



```

Authority

&#x20;   ↓

Authorization

&#x20;   ↓

Intent

&#x20;   ↓

PolicyReference

&#x20;   ↓

Decision

&#x20;   ↓

Execution

```



Changing the policy changes the trust chain.



\---



\# Determinism



Deterministic execution requires:



\* explicit PolicyReference

\* immutable versioned policies

\* evaluation of exactly one policy

\* no policy discovery

\* no policy guessing



\---



\# Design Principles



1\. Policy selection is an authorization decision.

2\. Policy execution is a runtime decision.

3\. PolicyRouter loads.

4\. PolicyRegistry manages.

5\. PolicyEngine evaluates.

6\. Runtime orchestrates.

7\. BusinessTransaction specifies the PolicyReference.

8\. PolicyReference is part of the trust chain.



\---



\# Architecture Lock



This architecture is locked.



Future changes may extend the policy language or storage mechanisms but must not change these responsibilities or reintroduce runtime policy discovery.
