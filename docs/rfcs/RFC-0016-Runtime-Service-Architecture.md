\# RFC-0016: Runtime Service Architecture



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\## Purpose



This RFC defines the canonical runtime service architecture for Parmana.



Phase 1 established the canonical domain model and deterministic policy execution pipeline.



This RFC defines how runtime services collaborate to execute that architecture while maintaining strict separation of responsibilities.



\---



\# Objectives



The runtime service architecture SHALL:



\* separate orchestration from business logic

\* isolate policy evaluation from decision construction

\* isolate execution from persistence

\* preserve deterministic execution

\* produce immutable execution artifacts

\* maintain a single responsibility for every runtime service



\---

```



The ExecutionService coordinates the workflow.



It does not contain business logic.

\# Architectural Invariants



The runtime SHALL satisfy the following invariants:



1\. Runtime services SHALL have a single responsibility.

2\. Policy evaluation SHALL occur only in the PolicyEngine.

3\. Decision construction SHALL occur only in the DecisionService.

4\. Execution orchestration SHALL occur only in the ExecutionService.

5\. ExecutionTrustRecord construction SHALL occur only in the ExecutionTrustRecordService.

6\. Receipt generation SHALL occur only in the ReceiptService.

7\. Verification SHALL occur only in the VerificationService.

8\. Runtime SHALL remain deterministic.

9\. Runtime SHALL remain domain independent.

10\. Business logic SHALL reside exclusively in policy artifacts.



\---



\# Remaining Phase 1 Implementation



The remaining implementation work SHALL proceed in the following order:



1\. Refactor ExecutionService into a pure orchestrator.

2\. Refactor ReceiptService to consume ExecutionTrustRecord.

3\. Refactor VerificationService to verify immutable execution artifacts.

4\. Complete ReplayService integration.

5\. Complete end-to-end integration tests.

6\. Validate persistence, replay, cryptographic receipts, and verification.



No additional architectural changes are required.



\---



\# Status



This RFC locks the runtime service architecture for Parmana Phase 1.



Future enhancements SHALL extend this architecture without changing the canonical execution trust chain or the single-responsibility service model.
