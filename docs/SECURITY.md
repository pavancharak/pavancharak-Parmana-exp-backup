\# Parmana Security Model



Version: 1.0



Status: Normative



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the security model of the Parmana Execution Trust Infrastructure.



It describes:



\* security objectives

\* trust boundaries

\* protected assets

\* threat model

\* implemented security controls

\* security assumptions



This document does not define organizational security policies or regulatory compliance requirements.



\---



\# Security Objectives



Parmana is designed to provide the following security properties.



\* Execution Integrity

\* Policy Integrity

\* Trust Chain Integrity

\* Evidence Integrity

\* Independent Verification

\* Deterministic Replay



These objectives support trustworthy execution rather than general application security.



\---



\# Security Scope



Parmana protects the integrity of the execution lifecycle.

\# Protected Assets



The following artifacts are security-sensitive.



\## Authority



Identity empowered to authorize execution.



\---



\## Authorization



Approval for execution.



\---



\## Intent



Declared business action.



\---



\## Business Transaction



Canonical execution request.



\---



\## Policy Reference



Binding between execution and business policy.



\---



\## Policy



Business decision logic.



\---



\## Decision



Result of policy evaluation.



\---



\## Execution



Performed runtime action.



\---



\## Execution Trust Record



Immutable execution evidence.



\---



\## Receipt



Cryptographic proof of execution evidence.



\---



\# Security Principles



\## Explicit Trust



Every execution SHALL originate from explicit trust artifacts.



Implicit authorization is not part of the security model.



\---



\## Immutable Evidence



Execution evidence SHOULD be treated as immutable once produced.



\---



\## Deterministic Policy Binding



The runtime SHALL execute only the explicitly referenced policy.



Policy discovery and automatic version selection are not permitted.



\---



\## Separation of Duties



Authorization, policy evaluation, execution, verification, and replay are independent responsibilities.



No component is expected to perform all responsibilities.



\---



\## Independent Verification



Execution evidence SHOULD be verifiable without trusting the runtime that produced it.



\---



\# Threat Model



The architecture is designed to reduce the likelihood or impact of the following threats.



\## Unauthorized Execution



Attempting to execute without required trust artifacts.



Mitigation:



\* BusinessTransactionValidator

\* TrustChainValidationComponent



\---



\## Policy Substitution



Executing a policy different from the one referenced by the Business Transaction.



Mitigation:



\* explicit PolicyReference

\* PolicyRouter

\* PolicyValidator



\---



\## Incomplete Trust Chain



Execution without Authority, Authorization, or Intent.



Mitigation:



\* trust-chain validation



\---



\## Evidence Tampering



Modification of execution evidence after execution.



Mitigation:



\* canonical hashing

\* digital signatures

\* verification



\---



\## Replay Manipulation



Modification of recorded execution before replay.



Mitigation:



\* replay verification

\* Trust Record validation



\---



\## Receipt Forgery



Creation of forged execution receipts.



Mitigation:



\* digital signatures

\* signature verification



\---



\# Trust Boundaries



Parmana assumes external systems are responsible for:



\* authentication

\* identity proofing

\* user management

\* policy authoring

\* infrastructure security

\* operating system security

\* network security

\* key management infrastructure



These systems are outside the scope of Parmana.



\---



\# Security Controls



The architecture includes controls such as:



\* Business Transaction validation

\* explicit Policy Reference

\* policy validation

\* deterministic policy evaluation

\* trust-chain validation

\* immutable execution evidence

\* canonical hashing

\* digital signatures

\* independent verification

\* replay verification



\---



\# Security Assumptions



The following assumptions apply.



\* Trusted cryptographic algorithms are used.

\* Signing keys are protected by the deployment environment.

\* Runtime components execute within a trusted computing environment.

\* Policies are authored and managed by trusted business processes.



Violation of these assumptions may reduce the effectiveness of the security model.



\---



\# Security Limitations



Parmana does not guarantee:



\* prevention of every software vulnerability

\* protection against compromised infrastructure

\* prevention of insider threats

\* protection against stolen signing keys

\* regulatory compliance

\* complete application security



Parmana provides execution trust infrastructure that can be integrated into broader security architectures.



\---



\# Security Verification



Security controls SHOULD be validated through:



\* automated tests

\* architectural audits

\* negative tests

\* independent verification

\* conformance testing



Security evidence is tracked in `PROOFS.md`.

\# Guiding Principle



Parmana does not attempt to make automated execution inherently trustworthy.



Instead, it provides the mechanisms required to establish, preserve, and verify trust throughout the execution lifecycle.
