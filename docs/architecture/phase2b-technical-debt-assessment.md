# Phase 2B — Independent Technical Debt Assessment & Next Priority Selection

An independent re-assessment of the repository's technical debt, performed as though by a reviewer with no memory of Phases 1A–2A.4's prioritization decisions. Every existing register entry is treated as a hypothesis re-checked against current source; every prior investigation (`docs/architecture/repository-certification.md`'s Technical Debt Register, and a previously-unaccounted-for `docs/investigations/GAP-AUDIT.md`) is advisory, not authoritative. This is an assessment only — no production source code was modified; `git status` at the end of this phase is confirmed clean.

**Assessed against:** commit `482c474` (`docs(certification): close TD-1 after operational verification`), the tip of `main`. Working tree was clean before this assessment began.

## Precondition Verification

```
git status              → clean
git log --oneline -10:
  482c474  docs(certification): close TD-1 after operational verification   (Phase 2A.4)
  e6a25ab  docs(operations): certify historical integrity after Phase 2A     (Phase 2A.3)
  0c19f78  docs(operations): verify Phase 2A production deployment           (Phase 2A.2)
  10c8064  docs(operations): independent readiness review...                 (Phase 2A.1)
  6eff8ec  fix(production): remove MockConnector from production...          (Phase 2A)
  ...
```

**TD-1 closure confirmation:** read `docs/operations/td1-closure-summary.md` directly — `**Status: CLOSED.**`. Cross-checked every location Phase 2A.4 updated (`repository-certification.md`, `execution-pipeline-report.md`, `phase2a-production-connectors.md`, `phase2a-deployment-verification.md`, `phase2a-historical-integrity-verification.md`): all show TD-1 as Closed, with consistent, dated addenda; none show Open/Pending/Outstanding/Unresolved as a current-state claim. Internally consistent. Proceeding.

## 1. Repository Health Summary

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | **Healthy** | Single execution pipeline, adapter ownership, and import boundaries independently re-certified in Phase 1H and unaffected by any change since; `tsc -b` clean (re-run this phase) |
| Documentation | **Needs Attention** | Core architecture docs are accurate and cross-referenced; but a substantial, previously-unaccounted-for investigation document (`docs/investigations/GAP-AUDIT.md`) existed without being folded into the canonical debt register until this phase, and CLAIMS.md/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md/ROADMAP-v1.md remain a separate, parallel tracking lineage never reconciled with the TD-numbered one |
| Testing | **Needs Attention** | Full suite green (942 passed, 40 correctly-skipped, 0 failed, re-run this phase); but `packages/receipt` has zero test files (though now understood to be unreferenced by production, §3), the `typescript/` SDK still has 5 of 9 empty test-stub files, and one test (`execution-failure.integration.test.ts`) is skipped for a reason that no longer applies |
| CI | **Needs Attention** | Build/lint/typecheck/test steps all independently re-run clean this phase; but the terminology guard step would still fail if triggered (TD-2, confirmed again this phase, blast radius unchanged) and no coverage threshold is enforced (TD-3) |
| Operations | **Healthy** | Phase 2A.2/2A.3 established direct, repeatable production-verification technique (the public `/ready` endpoint plus timestamp-correlated `pg_stat_activity` observation); production confirmed live and healthy at last check |
| Deployment | **Healthy** | Fly release `v40` live, both machines healthy; deployment process (worktree-pinned `flyctl deploy`) is now a demonstrated, repeatable pattern |
| Security | **Healthy** | Caller authentication, credential isolation, replay protection, and fail-closed connector resolution all independently re-verified across Phases 1H–2A.3; no new security-relevant gap found this phase beyond the low-severity comment-hygiene item in §3 (TD-17) |
| Public APIs | **Needs Attention** | `packages/execution-gateway`'s barrel is confirmed clean (Phase 1H); but `@parmana/receipt` is a fully-implemented, tutorial-facing public package with zero test coverage of its own and zero production consumers (§3, TD-8 revisited) |
| Developer Experience | **Needs Attention** | `check-dist-fresh.ts` (a genuine, confirmed fix for a real historical gap, §2) and fail-closed config errors (`PARMANA_POLICY_DIR`, `DATABASE_PROVIDER`) are strong positives; but stale/misleading TODO comments in production bootstrap files (TD-17) and a duplicated field-extraction pattern with no drift-guard (TD-9) are real, if minor, friction points |

No area is classified **High Risk**. Nothing found this phase rises to that bar — every item is either already resolved, or open at Medium severity or below (§3).

## 2. Existing Technical Debt (Independently Re-Verified)

### From `docs/architecture/repository-certification.md`'s Technical Debt Register (Phase 1H)

| ID | Phase 1H severity | Verification result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| TD-1 | High | **Closed** (confirmed, see Precondition Verification above) | — |
| TD-2 | High | **Still Exists** — and its blast radius has grown | Reproduced the exact CI guard `grep` from `ci.yml`: still fails on `docs/site/changelog.mdx:93`. **New this phase:** the guard now *also* matches `repository-certification.md`'s own prose (quoting "execution governance" while describing TD-2 itself) — a second file would now trip it, not just one |
| TD-3 | Medium | **Still Exists** | `grep -n "coverage" .github/workflows/ci.yml` finds only an unrelated `--exclude-dir=coverage` in the terminology guard; `npm run coverage` is never invoked as a CI step |
| TD-4 | Low | **Still Exists** | `grep -n "WorkdayConnector\|SapConnector\|SalesforceConnector\|OracleConnector" docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` — zero matches, still undocumented |
| TD-5 | Low | **Still Exists** | `system-architecture.md`'s dependency graph still has no `storage`/`replay` entries |
| TD-6 | Low | **Still Exists** | `policies/vendor-payment/` still contains only `2.0.0`, not the `1.0.0` `EXECUTION-FLOW-AUDIT.md` cites |
| TD-7 | Low | **Still Exists** | `createVendorPaymentSecureConnector.ts` still 0 bytes |
| TD-8 | Low | **Still Exists, with new context** | `packages/receipt/package.json` still lacks the type-only dependency declarations. **New this phase:** `@parmana/receipt` has **zero consumers anywhere in `packages/*/src`** — it is used only by three tutorial scripts (`examples/tutorials/{54,55,56}-*`). Production's real receipt flow is `ReceiptService`/`ReceiptCrypto` (runtime/crypto), an entirely separate implementation. This re-contextualizes TD-8: the packaging-hygiene risk is real but its blast radius is "tutorial consumers of the standalone package," not production |

### From `docs/investigations/GAP-AUDIT.md` (2026-07-07 snapshot, commit `4a3c2b9` — pre-dates every Phase 1/2 commit; never previously reconciled with the TD register)

| New ID | Item | Original severity | Verification result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | MUST-FIX-1 (stale `dist/`, no staleness prevention) | High (systemic gap) | **Resolved** | `scripts/check-dist-fresh.ts` exists and is wired as the `pretest` script (`package.json:31`); confirmed running and passing in this phase's own `npm test` invocation |
| — | MUST-FIX-2 (API has no authentication) | High | **Resolved** | `packages/api/src/auth/` now contains `CallerAuthenticator.ts`, `StaticKeyAuthenticator.ts`, `hashApiKey.ts`, `isPrincipalAllowed.ts`, `isOwnedByCaller.ts`; `packages/api/src/middleware/caller-auth.ts` wired conditionally in `app.ts:151` |
| — | MUST-FIX-3 (`PARMANA_STORAGE`/`DATABASE_PROVIDER` mismatch, silent memory fallback) | High | **Resolved, and hardened beyond the audit's suggested fix** | `ConfigValidation.ts:32-38` now explicitly **throws** if the retired `DATABASE_PROVIDER` is set at all ("DATABASE_PROVIDER is no longer read; set PARMANA_STORAGE instead"), rather than the audit's more modest "pick one, delete the other" suggestion |
| — | MUST-FIX-4 (`PARMANA_POLICY_DIR` no fallback, confusing crash) | High | **Resolved, via fail-closed error rather than the suggested fallback** | `Config.ts:97-103` now throws an explicit, named error ("PARMANA_POLICY_DIR is not set. Refusing to start...") instead of a bare non-null-assertion crash. Judgment note: this is arguably a *better* fix than the audit's suggested repo-relative fallback — consistent with this codebase's established fail-closed convention (README: "a misconfigured process refuses to start rather than degrade silently") rather than introducing implicit magic |
| **TD-9** | SHOULD-FIX-1 (duplicated `ExecutableContent` extraction) | Low | **Still Exists** | `packages/runtime/src/ExecutionRequestBuilder.ts:24-38` still manually re-lists the four fields instead of calling `toExecutableContent()`; confirmed via direct read, `RuntimeEngine.ts` is still the only caller of the shared helper |
| — | SHOULD-FIX-2 (CLAIMS.md/`claim.md` markdown escaping) | Low | **Resolved** | `docs/CLAIMS.md`'s headers render as clean markdown (no literal `\#`); root `claim.md` no longer exists in the tree |
| **TD-10** | SHOULD-FIX-3 (`typescript/` SDK: 9 empty test stub files) | Session-sized | **Partially Resolved** | `Configuration.test.ts` (83 lines), `Errors.test.ts` (192), `HttpTransport.test.ts` (454), `NewApiMethods.test.ts` (159, new), plus a new `integration/parmana-client.integration.test.ts` (356) all now have real content. Still empty (0 lines): `HealthApi.test.ts`, `ParmanaClient.test.ts`, `PolicyApi.test.ts`, `ReplayApi.test.ts`, `VerificationApi.test.ts` |
| **TD-11** | SHOULD-FIX-4 (`ExecutionEvidenceComponent` dead no-op) | Low | **Still Exists** | Confirmed unreferenced anywhere outside its own file (`grep -rln "ExecutionEvidenceComponent" packages/*/src` → only its own file); still literally `return context;` with a `// TODO: Build ExecutionEvidence...` comment |
| **TD-12** | KNOWN-PARKED: `OverrideService`/`OverrideVerifier` unreachable | Guarded | **Still True** | Zero references from `packages/api/src/**`, confirmed by direct grep |
| **TD-13** | KNOWN-PARKED: Replay/Storage subsystem unreachable from `/replay` | Tier 1 | **Still True** | Zero references to `ReplayExecutor`/`ReplayPipeline` from `packages/api/src` |
| **TD-14** | KNOWN-PARKED: `LedgerSerializer` replacer-array bug | Documented, dead code | **Still True** | `packages/storage/src/ledger/LedgerSerializer.ts:9` still has the exact `JSON.stringify(entry, Object.keys(entry).sort())` bug; still dead code (same orphaned-subsystem finding above) |
| **TD-15** | KNOWN-PARKED: `execution-failure.integration.test.ts` permanently skipped | Tier 1 | **Still skipped, but the stated blocker is now resolved** | The skip's own comment says the blocker is "`RuntimeFactory` always creates a `DefaultExecutionSystem` internally, making it impossible to inject a failing implementation." Read `RuntimeFactory.create()` directly: `executionSystem: ExecutionSystem` is now a **required** constructor parameter (`RuntimeFactory.ts:41`) — it does not construct a `DefaultExecutionSystem` internally at all. The test's own stated reason for being skipped is stale; nobody has revisited it since the DI seam was added |

IDs are assigned continuing from the existing TD-1–TD-8 register (`repository-certification.md`) so both lineages share one numbering scheme going forward (§8 of `td1-closure-summary.md`'s traceability precedent). Items marked "—" are resolved and are not carried into the active register.

## 3. Newly Discovered Technical Debt (this phase)

| ID | Description | Evidence | Severity (see §4 for scoring) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TD-16** | `ReceiptCrypto` (`packages/crypto/src/ReceiptCrypto.ts:27`) and `SettlementConfirmationCrypto` (self-documented as "structurally identical") each directly instantiate their own `FileKeyProvider()`, bypassing whatever key-provider selection the rest of the system's "crypto composition root" (`CryptoBootstrap`) would otherwise apply. Both are self-documented as temporary ("Will later be supplied by the crypto composition root"). Confirmed live: `packages/runtime/src/services/receipt-service.ts:22` — `ReceiptService`, the real production receipt-generation path, directly constructs `new ReceiptCrypto()`. | Not currently exploitable — `FileKeyProvider`/`KEY_PROVIDER=local` is the only implemented key provider anywhere in the repository today (confirmed: `docs/site/roadmap.mdx` "Move 1" still lists KMS/HSM providers as declared-but-unimplemented). But this is a **latent** gap: the moment a KMS/HSM provider is implemented (roadmap Move 1) and the rest of the system migrates, Receipt and Settlement Confirmation signing would silently continue using the local filesystem key with no error, no warning, and no test to catch the divergence. | Medium |
| **TD-17** | `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createGatewayIdentity.ts` and `createSessionStore.ts` carry explicit `TODO: Replace ... with your production gateway identity / production authentication mechanism` comments that read as unresolved security gaps. Traced both fully: `createGatewayIdentity()`'s hardcoded `"parmana-gateway"` string is a non-secret label whose actual security weight is zero — the real authentication is `SignedTokenConnectorAuthenticator.authenticateGateway()`'s cryptographic signature verification (`GatewayAttestationSigner`/`gatewayPrivateKey`), which the identity label merely accompanies. `createSessionStore.ts`'s `gatewaySessionIssuanceAuthentication = Object.freeze({})` is checked by **strict reference equality** (`InMemoryGatewaySessionStore.create()`, confirmed by reading the source: `issuanceAuthentication !== this.issuanceAuthentication`), not by content — meaning its *value* (even if it were a "real" secret) is architecturally irrelevant, since Gateway and ExecutionControl run in the same process and no external actor can ever construct a matching object reference. | Both TODOs are misleading, not describing a real exploitable gap; independently traced end-to-end this phase, not inferred from the comment text | Low (comment-hygiene / developer-confusion risk, not a security gap) |
| **TD-18** | `GET /transactions` (`packages/api/src/routes/transactions.ts:58-64`) filters caller-scoped results **after** pagination is applied, not by pushing the scope into the storage query. Self-documented, honest, and explicitly scoped as "a pagination-correctness follow-up, not a security gap" (never over-discloses another caller's data, only under-fills a page). | Direct read of the route handler and its own comment | Low |

No other TODO/FIXME/XXX, disabled test, CI exclusion, or "temporary"-flagged code was found beyond what's catalogued above and in §2 — confirmed by a repository-wide sweep (`TODO|FIXME|XXX`, `HACK`, `not yet implemented`, `[Tt]emporary`, `deferred`, `follow-up`, `\.skip\(`) across `packages/*/src` and `packages/*/tests`, cross-checked item by item.

## 4. Risk Matrix (remaining open items only — closed/resolved items excluded)

| ID | Security | Production | Operational | Architectural | Dev Productivity | Likelihood | Business Impact | Remediation Complexity | **Overall** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TD-2 | None | None | High (CI gate actively broken) | None | Medium (false failure erodes CI trust) | Certain (reproduced live) | Low (terminology/branding, not security or correctness) | Trivial (1-line exclude-list edit, or move the note) | **High** (process integrity) |
| TD-3 | Low | None | Medium (silent coverage regressions) | None | Medium | Certain (absence confirmed) | Low-Medium | Low (add a CI step) | **Medium** |
| TD-13 (Replay unreachable) | None | Low | Low | Medium (claimed-but-unwired capability) | Low | Certain | Medium (CLAIMS.md 2.7 already self-caveats "untested at the live route," limiting overclaim risk) | Medium (needs a route + design decision on exposure) | **Medium** |
| TD-15 (execution-failure test) | None | Low | Low | None | Medium (missing regression coverage for failure-path evidence) | Certain (skip confirmed) | Medium (thematically central: does failure produce honest evidence?) | Low-Medium (blocker gone; needs the test re-verified against current API, not rewritten) | **Medium** |
| TD-16 (ReceiptCrypto composition root bypass) | Low today, Medium-future | Low today | Low | Medium (silent future divergence) | Low | Low today (no KMS provider exists yet to diverge from); High if/when Move 1 ships | Low today | Medium (needs the composition-root seam threaded through, or an explicit decision to defer) | **Medium** (time-bombed, not urgent) |
| TD-4, TD-5, TD-6, TD-7, TD-8, TD-9, TD-10, TD-11, TD-12, TD-14, TD-17, TD-18 | None | None | Low | Low | Low | Certain | Low | Trivial–Low | **Low** |

No item scores **Critical**. TD-2 is the only item independently reaching **High** — not because the thing it protects (terminology consistency) is itself high-stakes, but because it is a *currently, verifiably broken automated gate*, which is a distinct and higher-order concern than any single open finding it might otherwise miss.

## 5. Dependency Graph

```
Independent, parallelizable (no shared files, no ordering constraint):
  TD-2  (ci.yml exclude-list)
  TD-3  (ci.yml coverage step)
  TD-4  (system-architecture.md prose)
  TD-5  (system-architecture.md prose)
  TD-6  (no action needed unless promoted)
  TD-7  (delete one 0-byte file)
  TD-9  (ExecutionRequestBuilder.ts)
  TD-11 (ExecutionEvidenceComponent.ts — finish or delete)
  TD-17 (comment text only)
  TD-18 (transactions.ts route, if ever addressed)

Sequenced (each requires investigation before implementation):
  TD-15 → requires confirming the un-skipped test actually passes against current
          API shape before enabling it (RuntimeFactory DI prerequisite already met)
  TD-13 → requires a design decision (should /replay exist as a route at all, and
          with what auth/scope) before any code is written — not a drop-in fix
  TD-16 → blocked, in practice, on nothing structurally, but low-value to fix before
          a KMS/HSM provider (roadmap Move 1) actually exists to diverge from;
          fixing now is speculative work against an unbuilt consumer
  TD-8  → best sequenced alongside any future decision on whether @parmana/receipt
          is kept (and gets tests) or deprecated (tutorials 54-56 migrated to the
          real ReceiptService/ReceiptCrypto path) — not urgent alone

No item blocks any other. Nothing here has a prerequisite among Phase 2A's own
closed work — TD-1's closure introduced no new dependency on any remaining item.
```

## 6. Repository Readiness

Independently re-run this phase, against commit `482c474`:

```
npx tsc -b                        → clean, 0 errors
npm run lint                      → clean
npm run typecheck                 → clean
npm test -- --maxWorkers=2        → 136 test files passed, 16 skipped;
                                     942 tests passed, 40 skipped, 0 failed
```

Repository is in a fully buildable, fully testable, green state. No blocked precondition exists for beginning new implementation work.

## 7. Implementation Readiness (remaining open items)

| ID | Readiness | Why |
|---|---|---|
| TD-2 | **Ready** | Exact fix already known (add `changelog.mdx` to the exclusion list, or move its historical note into an already-exempted file); zero design surface |
| TD-3 | **Ready** | Add `npm run coverage` as a CI step; threshold value is the only open question, and a conservative starting threshold (or none, just visibility) is a reasonable default |
| TD-4, TD-5 | **Ready** | Both are additive documentation edits with a clear, narrow scope |
| TD-6 | **Blocked (deliberately, not urgently)** | No action needed unless the file is promoted to living-doc status — there is nothing to implement today |
| TD-7 | **Ready** | Delete one 0-byte file |
| TD-8 | **Needs Investigation** | Fixing the `package.json` alone is trivial, but the newly-surfaced context (§2 — zero production consumers, only tutorial consumers) means the *right* fix depends on a decision this assessment shouldn't make unilaterally: keep `@parmana/receipt` as a maintained public-facing library (add tests, fix the dependency declaration) or deprecate it in favor of the tutorials using the real `ReceiptService`/`ReceiptCrypto` path |
| TD-9 | **Ready** | One-line change: call `toExecutableContent()` from `ExecutionRequestBuilder.build()` |
| TD-11 | **Needs Investigation** | "Finish it or delete it" — either is a small change, but which one requires knowing whether `ExecutionEvidenceComponent` was meant to become live pipeline wiring (finish) or was superseded by evidence now captured elsewhere (delete); not visible from the code alone |
| TD-12, TD-13, TD-14 | **Needs Investigation** | All three are dead/orphaned-subsystem findings where the correct action (wire it in, or delete it) depends on product intent this codebase's own artifacts don't settle |
| TD-15 | **Needs Investigation** | Blocker confirmed resolved (§2), but the test itself needs to be run un-skipped and checked against the current API shape before trusting it — not a blind un-skip |
| TD-16 | **Needs Investigation** | Fixing it now means designing a "crypto composition root" seam for a KMS provider that doesn't exist yet — premature without Move 1 (roadmap) being scheduled |
| TD-17 | **Ready** | Comment-text-only correction; no behavior change |
| TD-18 | **Ready**, but explicitly low-priority | Already correctly scoped by its own comment as a known, accepted trade-off, not an active defect |

## 8. Recommended Next Phase

**Recommended: TD-2 — CI terminology guard failing against the current tree.**

**Why this outranks every other remaining item, based on current evidence:**

- **It is the only item independently scored High** (§4) — not on inherent stakes (terminology consistency is low business-impact on its own), but because it is the only finding that is *actively, verifiably broken right now* in an automated gate every future change passes through. A broken CI check is a different class of problem than a missing feature or an untested path: it degrades confidence in every subsequent green checkmark, for every future phase, not just this one issue.
- **Zero remediation complexity, zero design surface.** The fix is fully specified already (an existing, already-solved precedent exists for `ROADMAP-v1.md`'s identical case) — add `changelog.mdx` to the guard's exclusion list, or relocate its one historical sentence. No investigation, no architectural decision, no stakeholder input needed.
- **Zero dependencies, blocks nothing, is blocked by nothing** (§5) — fully independent, fully parallelizable, immediately actionable.
- **Its blast radius has grown since it was first found** (§2) — a second file (`repository-certification.md` itself) now also trips the same guard, which is exactly the kind of "small problem that quietly gets worse while unaddressed" this assessment is meant to surface before it compounds further.

**Why each higher-severity-looking or thematically-appealing alternative was not selected:**

- **TD-3 (no coverage enforcement, Medium):** genuinely valuable, but requires a judgment call (what threshold, gate or just report) that TD-2 doesn't — slightly higher design surface for lower urgency (nothing is *currently broken*, coverage is simply unmeasured).
- **TD-15 (execution-failure test, Medium):** thematically the most appealing candidate — directly continuous with the evidence-integrity concern this entire TD-1 program was about — and now correctly unblocked. But "Needs Investigation" (§7): the test must be verified against the current API shape before trusting it, which is real, if modest, work TD-2 doesn't require. A strong second choice for the phase immediately after this one.
- **TD-13 (Replay unreachable, Medium):** requires a product decision (should `/replay` exist as a route, with what auth) before any code gets written — not implementation-ready today.
- **TD-16 (ReceiptCrypto composition-root bypass, Medium):** genuinely latent risk, but fixing it today means building a seam for a KMS provider that doesn't exist yet (roadmap Move 1 is unscheduled) — premature relative to its actual current exposure (none; `FileKeyProvider` is the only real provider in existence).
- **TD-8/TD-11/TD-12/TD-14 (Low, dead/orphaned code and packaging items):** each individually smaller in impact than TD-2, and several ("Needs Investigation") require a keep-or-delete product decision this assessment correctly declines to make unilaterally.

**No item scored Critical**, so this recommendation is not driven by urgency in the security or production-safety sense — TD-2 wins on a straightforward value/effort/risk basis: highest-scoring open item, trivial cost, zero dependencies, actively regressing if left alone.

## 9. Deferred Items

Every item in §2/§3 not selected in §8 remains open and tracked, unchanged in priority ranking beyond what §4's fresh scoring already reflects. None are deferred due to disagreement with their original classification — each is deferred because §8's comparison found a better-justified next step. Specifically flagged as worth a dedicated, product-level decision before implementation (not just an engineering task): TD-8 (keep vs. deprecate `@parmana/receipt`), TD-11 (finish vs. delete `ExecutionEvidenceComponent`), TD-12/TD-13/TD-14 (wire in vs. delete the Override/Replay/Ledger orphaned subsystems).

## 10. Assessment Methodology

Every item was checked against current source directly — `grep`, targeted file reads, and (for TD-15) tracing a class's constructor signature to confirm a stated blocker no longer holds — rather than trusted from either prior document's own text. Where a prior document's severity or status was confirmed unchanged, that confirmation is evidenced above, not assumed. Where new evidence changed the understanding of an existing item (TD-8's true consumer set; TD-2's grown blast radius), that is stated explicitly rather than silently inherited. New debt was searched for via a repository-wide sweep for `TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX`/`HACK`/"not (yet) implemented"/"temporary"/"deferred"/"follow-up" markers and `.skip(`-style test exclusions, with every hit individually triaged (several — the `BusinessTrustRecordBuilder.ts`/`RefusalRecordBuilder.ts` "Temporary Trust Record for hashing" comments — were confirmed to be ordinary local-variable naming, not debt, and excluded). Build/lint/typecheck/test were independently re-run this phase against the current commit, not assumed carried-over from Phase 2A.4.

## 11. Evidence Summary

- Direct source reads: `createGatewayIdentity.ts`, `createSessionStore.ts`, `InMemoryGatewaySessionStore.ts`, `SignedTokenConnectorAuthenticator.ts`, `ReceiptCrypto.ts`, `RuntimeFactory.ts`, `ExecutionRequestBuilder.ts`, `ExecutionEvidenceComponent.ts`, `StorageFactory.ts`, `ConfigValidation.ts`, `Config.ts`, `transactions.ts`, `LedgerSerializer.ts`, and others cited inline above.
- Repository-wide greps re-run fresh this phase (not reused from any prior phase's cached results): `implements Connector`-adjacent patterns were not re-run (unaffected by anything in this phase's scope); `TODO|FIXME|XXX`, `HACK`, "not (yet) implemented", `[Tt]emporary`, `deferred`, `follow-up`, `.skip(`, `@parmana/receipt` consumers, `OverrideService`/`OverrideVerifier`/`ReplayExecutor`/`ReplayPipeline` reachability, the exact CI terminology-guard command, and the `typescript/test/*.test.ts` line counts.
- `git log --follow`/`git show` were not needed this phase — no new provenance question arose that source-reading and cross-referencing `docs/investigations/GAP-AUDIT.md`'s own dated snapshot (`main @ 4a3c2b9`, 2026-07-07) didn't already resolve.
- Build/test evidence: `npx tsc -b`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test -- --maxWorkers=2` all independently re-run this phase against commit `482c474`, all clean.

---

## Final Recommendation

**BEGIN NEXT IMPLEMENTATION PHASE.**

**Target: TD-2 — fix the CI terminology guard's exclusion list so it stops failing against the current tree** (`docs/site/changelog.mdx`, and now also `docs/architecture/repository-certification.md`).

This outranks every other remaining item because it is the only finding independently scored High in this phase's fresh risk matrix (§4), carries essentially zero remediation complexity or design surface (§7: Ready), has no dependencies in either direction (§5), and its blast radius has measurably grown since it was first documented — the clearest available signal that leaving it alone has a real, if small, ongoing cost. Every item that might otherwise seem more consequential (TD-15's evidence-integrity theme, TD-3's coverage visibility, TD-13's claims-accuracy angle, TD-16's future KMS-migration risk) either requires a decision or investigation step this item does not, or represents latent rather than currently-active risk.
