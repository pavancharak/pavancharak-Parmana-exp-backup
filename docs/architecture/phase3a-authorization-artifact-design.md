# Phase 3A — Authorization Artifact Design

An architecture and specification phase only. **No production source code changed. No public API changed.** This document is a frozen specification for a new cryptographic artifact — to be implemented, if at all, in a separately-chartered future phase.

**Fixed against:** commit `72e6da5` (`docs(architecture): independently re-verify remaining authorization exceptions (TD-23)`), the tip of `main`. Working tree was clean before this phase began.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Phase 2L (§2, §3, read directly — see §3 below) independently confirmed two authorization facts that `PolicyEngine` evaluates but that are never independently verified: the Razorpay `razorpay-refund/1.0.0` policy's `dailyCumulativeAfterThisRefundPaise`, and the HubSpot `hubspot-deal-update/1.0.0` policy's `preAuthorizedForAmountChange`. Both are caller-declared, and both directly gate whether a real, fund-moving or record-mutating execution is approved. This phase's charter is to determine — from repository evidence, not assumption — whether closing either gap requires a genuinely new cryptographic authorization primitive, or whether existing infrastructure can simply be extended.

## 2. Independent Verification Summary

This phase did not re-derive the two findings from scratch a third time — Phase 2L already did that independently, twice removed from the original marketing-claim verification (Phase 2K's own report, itself independently re-derived from the original verification task). Instead, this phase's Precondition step (§3) independently confirmed Phase 2L's report exists, is committed, and is readable, and re-read its conclusions directly rather than trusting a summary of it. Its findings are treated as established fact for the purposes of this design phase's own charter (deciding what, if anything, to build in response), not re-litigated.

## 3. Phase 2L Scope Verification

Read directly from `docs/architecture/phase2l-authorization-exceptions.md` (commit `72e6da5`), not from any summary:

- **Exactly two capabilities violated Property B:** `razorpay:refund-create` (§2 of that report) and `hubspot:deal-update` (§3 of that report).
- **Exactly which fields were caller-controlled:** `signals.dailyCumulativeAfterThisRefundPaise` (Razorpay) and `signals.preAuthorizedForAmountChange` (HubSpot) — named explicitly, nothing broader.
- **Whether these are genuinely separate problems or one architectural limitation:** Phase 2L's own text (§7) already draws a distinction worth taking seriously: it recommends *"a dedicated future phase to design and wire a real cumulative-refund ledger"* for Razorpay, and *"a dedicated future phase to design a signed pre-authorization artifact"* for HubSpot — two different nouns (a ledger; an artifact), not one. This phase's own independent analysis (§4 below) confirms Phase 2L's implicit distinction was correct: **these are not the same problem.** One is a missing internal aggregation over data Parmana already owns and has already cryptographically committed to (its own historical Trust Records). The other is a missing external attestation from a party that is neither the AI caller nor Parmana's own runtime — a fact no existing system, internal or external, currently records at all.

## 4. Existing Infrastructure Assessment

Read directly, fresh, for this phase (not assumed from any prior phase's inventory):

| Primitive | File(s) | What it does | Reusable as-is for a new artifact? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical serialization | `packages/crypto/src/CanonicalSerializer.ts` | Deterministic, key-sorted, UTF-8 byte serialization of any object | **Yes** — algorithm-agnostic, no changes needed |
| Deterministic hashing | `packages/crypto/src/TrustRecordHasher.ts`, `ExecutableContentHasher.ts` | Canonical-serialize then hash; the exact mechanism `businessTransactionHash` uses | **Yes** — the same hasher can bind any new payload shape |
| Signing | `packages/crypto/src/ArtifactSigner.ts` | Canonical-serialize, then `crypto.signature.sign(bytes, privateKey)` | **Yes** — takes `unknown`, no payload-shape assumption |
| Signature verification | `packages/crypto/src/SignatureVerifier.ts` | Canonical-serialize, then `crypto.signature.verify(bytes, signature, publicKey)` | **Yes** — same, payload-shape-agnostic |
| Signature algorithms | `packages/shared/src/config/CryptoAlgorithms.ts` | `ed25519` (default), `dilithium3`/ML-DSA-65 (configurable) | **Yes** — `SignatureAlgorithm` type reusable verbatim |
| Execution Authorization envelope | `packages/shared/src/domain/execution-authorization.ts`, `packages/crypto/src/{AuthorizationSigner,AuthorizationVerifier}.ts` | Signed by **Parmana's own runtime key** (`FileKeyProvider`, `DEFAULT_KEY_ID`), issued **after** `PolicyEngine.evaluate` approves, proves "Parmana's runtime approved this decision" | **Not directly** — this artifact attests to Parmana's own decision, not an independent third party's; reusing its *signing key* would make the new artifact self-certifying (the AI's own request would end up "approved" by the same process that needs to consult independent evidence) |
| Nonce / replay protection | `packages/envelope-verifier/src/NonceStore.ts` (`checkAndRecord(nonce, expiresAt): Promise<boolean>`) | Atomic burn-on-first-use, TTL-bounded | **Yes** — the interface itself is payload-agnostic; a new artifact can burn nonces through the exact same interface (a separate logical store/table to avoid colliding with Gateway authorization nonces, discussed in §6) |
| Second existing signed-artifact precedent | `packages/shared/src/domain/refusal-record.ts` (RFC-0021) | A durable, signed artifact distinct from `ExecutionTrustRecord`/Receipt, proving a policy REJECT — still signed with Parmana's own key, but establishes that **this codebase already treats "more than one kind of signed domain artifact" as an ordinary, existing pattern**, not a foreign concept | Precedent, not directly reusable (same-key limitation as Execution Authorization) |
| Trusted-identity registry precedent | `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createConnectorAuthenticator.ts` | A hardcoded, server-side list of `{connectorId, publicIdentity}` pairs, checked by `SignedTokenConnectorAuthenticator` | **Precedent to follow** for a new "trusted approval issuer" registry (§9) — same shape of problem (verify a claimed identity against a small, server-controlled trust list), not literally reusable code |
| Policy condition operators | `packages/policy/src/OperatorEvaluator.ts`, `PolicyOperator` enum (`eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `between`, ...) | The vocabulary `PolicyEngine` already uses to compare a fact against a literal | **Yes** — directly reusable as the new artifact's own scope-comparison vocabulary (§7), avoiding a second, parallel comparison DSL |
| `SignalStateVerifier` extension point | `packages/policy/src/types/SignalStateVerifier.ts`, `CompositeSignalStateVerifier.ts` | Optional, capability-scoped, independently re-derives specific facts and overrides an APPROVE to REJECT on mismatch — the exact seam TD-23's two findings live inside today | **Yes, for the Razorpay ledger case** — extending an *existing* `RazorpaySignalStateVerifier` implementation to also independently recompute `dailyCumulativeAfterThisRefundPaise` from Parmana's own storage is architecturally identical to what it already does for four other facts |
| `ExecutionTrustRecordRepository` | `packages/shared/src/repositories/execution-trust-record-repository.ts` | Durable store of every approved execution — **but its interface offers only `findByTransactionId(id)`, no query/aggregation by date range or action** | Data already exists and is already cryptographically committed (each record's own `trustRecordHash`/`signature`); the *interface* would need one new query method — an extension, not a new primitive |

**Conclusion, per finding, supported by the table above:**

- **Razorpay daily cumulative cap:** the fact this policy needs (a sum of today's already-approved, already-signed, already-stored refund amounts) is data Parmana **already owns and has already cryptographically committed to**. No new signing party, no new trust boundary, no new artifact type is needed — only a new query/aggregation capability layered onto the existing `ExecutionTrustRecordRepository` and consumed by the existing, already-extensible `RazorpaySignalStateVerifier`. This is **Existing Infrastructure Extension**.
- **HubSpot `preAuthorizedForAmountChange`:** the fact this policy needs (did some independent, authoritative party — a human manager, a business approval workflow — actually approve this specific over-threshold change) is **not data Parmana owns today, in any form, signed or not**. No existing artifact represents "an entity other than the AI caller and other than Parmana's own runtime attests to a specific, bounded fact." Reusing the Execution Authorization's signing key would not add security value, because that key represents Parmana's own runtime's decision, not an independent party's — using it to also sign the caller's own claim would be Parmana certifying its own input, not verifying someone else's. This gap **cannot** be closed by extending `AuthorizationVerifier`, `SignalStateVerifier`, or any other existing verification component without first inventing the artifact those components would then verify. This requires **a new authorization primitive** — built, per the table above, almost entirely from existing cryptographic building blocks, but a new payload shape, a new trust boundary, and a new issuance/verification integration point nonetheless.

## 5. Decision Gate Outcome

**Split verdict, per finding, each independently supported by repository evidence (§4):**

- **Razorpay daily cumulative cap → PATH A, Existing Infrastructure Extension.** **DESIGN NOT REQUIRED** for this finding. No Authorization Artifact is designed or needed here. **Recommended, separately-chartered implementation phase:** add one query method to `ExecutionTrustRecordRepository` (both `MemoryExecutionTrustRecordRepository` and `SupabaseExecutionTrustRecordRepository` implementations) that sums `intent.parameters.amountPaise` across today's approved `razorpay:refund-create` executions (scope decision left to that phase: per-payment-account vs. global daily total — Phase 2L's own recommendation already flagged this as an open scope question); extend `RazorpaySignalStateVerifier` to add `dailyCumulativeAfterThisRefundPaise` to its own `VERIFIED_SIGNAL_KEYS`, computing the "actual" value from this new query exactly as it already does for `paymentStatus`/`paymentCurrency`/`refundableRemainingPaise`/`requestedExceedsRemainder`. The TOCTOU/concurrency race Phase 2L flagged (two concurrent refunds each reading a stale cumulative total before either commits) is a real, separate design question that phase must resolve explicitly (e.g., an atomic increment-and-check against a dedicated ledger row, mirroring the `consumed_nonces`/`razorpay_webhook_events` primary-key-as-atomicity pattern already used elsewhere in this codebase) — not assumed away by a naive sum-then-compare query.
- **HubSpot `preAuthorizedForAmountChange` → PATH B, New Authorization Primitive Required.** The remainder of this document (§6 onward) is the frozen specification for that primitive.

This document's remaining sections are scoped to the HubSpot-class problem — **and, by design, to any future policy that needs an independent, external, bounded approval of a fact `PolicyEngine` cannot itself verify** (the artifact is deliberately generalized, not HubSpot-specific — see §6's `capability`/`resourceId`/`scope` fields). It is **not** a design for the Razorpay ledger, which needs no new artifact at all.

---

## 6. Requirements Matrix

Every authorization decision the repository currently performs in production (the 6 capabilities canonically bound to a policy, TD-22), every input, and its classification — re-derived directly from current source for this phase, extending (not merely repeating) Phase 2L's own trace:

| Capability | Resource | Scope | Business object | Input | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `razorpay:payment-fetch` | Razorpay payment (read) | read-only | `parameters.paymentId` | `paymentId` | Structural (bound to `intent`, execution is read-only) |
| `razorpay:refund-fetch` | Razorpay refund (read) | read-only | `parameters.refundId` | `refundId` | Structural |
| `razorpay:refund-create` | Razorpay refund (create) | write, fund-moving | `parameters.paymentId` | `paymentId` | Business-State Verified (real Razorpay fetch, `RazorpaySignalStateVerifier`) |
| — | — | — | — | `paymentStatus`, `paymentCurrency`, `refundableRemainingPaise`, `requestedExceedsRemainder` | Business-State Verified |
| — | — | — | — | `requestedRefundAmountPaise` / `parameters.amountPaise` | Cryptographically Verified (bound via `SignalIntentBinder`, itself covered by the signed `businessTransactionHash`) |
| — | — | — | — | `policy.name`/`.version` | Structural (`CapabilityPolicyBinder`, TD-22) |
| — | — | — | — | **`dailyCumulativeAfterThisRefundPaise`** | **Caller Asserted** — see §5's Path A recommendation |
| `hubspot:deal-fetch` | HubSpot deal (read) | read-only | `parameters.dealId` | `dealId` | Structural |
| `hubspot:deal-update` | HubSpot deal (update) | write, record-mutating | `parameters.dealId` | `dealId` | Business-State Verified (real HubSpot fetch, `HubSpotSignalStateVerifier`) |
| — | — | — | — | `currentDealStage`, `dealStageTransitionAllowed`, `amountChangeExceedsThreshold`, `amountDeltaAbs` | Business-State Verified |
| — | — | — | — | `proposedDealStage`/`parameters.dealstage`, `proposedAmount`/`parameters.amount` | Cryptographically Verified (bound via `SignalIntentBinder`) |
| — | — | — | — | `policy.name`/`.version` | Structural (`CapabilityPolicyBinder`, TD-22) |
| — | — | — | — | **`preAuthorizedForAmountChange`** | **Caller Asserted** — this document's subject |
| `payments:execute` (vendor-payment, **not currently registered in production, TD-1**) | vendor-payment (execute) | write, fund-moving | `parameters.target`/`vendorId` | `vendorVerified`, `invoiceVerified`, `paymentApproved`, `sufficientFunds`, `riskScore` | **Caller Asserted** — disclosed in `docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-24 as unaddressed, out of scope there too; not currently exploitable in production since this capability is not registered (TD-1), but the same class of gap, and directly why this artifact's design (§7) is kept general rather than HubSpot-specific |

No input in this matrix was classified **Unable to Certify** — every field's provenance is directly traceable to source, confirmed fresh for this phase.

**Note on generality:** the `payments:execute` row is included specifically because it demonstrates this is not a two-instance, capability-specific problem — it is a general shape ("an attestation about business trustworthiness or approval that no fetchable external system records") that recurs, and the artifact this document specifies is designed to cover all three occurrences, not only HubSpot's.

## 7. Authorization Artifact Specification

**Name:** `ApprovalArtifact` (payload: `ApprovalPayload`; signed envelope: `SignedApproval`) — naming mirrors `ExecutionAuthorizationPayload`/`SignedExecutionAuthorization` exactly, for consistency with this codebase's existing convention.

### 7.1 Payload fields

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `version` | `1` (literal) | **Yes** | Payload format version. Verifiers MUST reject any other value (including missing) before attempting signature verification — identical discipline to `ExecutionAuthorizationPayload.version`. |
| `approvalId` | `string` (UUID v4) | **Yes** | Unique identifier for this artifact. |
| `issuer.approverId` | `string` | **Yes** | Identifies the approving party — a human role, an approval-workflow system identity, or equivalent. **Never** the AI caller's own `callerId`, and **never** Parmana's own runtime identity. |
| `issuer.keyId` | `string` | **Yes** | Identifies which of that approver's registered public keys signed this artifact (an approver may rotate keys; mirrors `SignedExecutionAuthorization.keyId`'s purpose exactly). |
| `issuedAt` | `string` (ISO-8601 UTC) | **Yes** | When the approval was granted. |
| `expiresAt` | `string` (ISO-8601 UTC) | **Yes** | Verifiers MUST reject an artifact past this time — identical discipline to `ExecutionAuthorizationPayload.expiresAt`. No default; an approver-chosen, bounded value, deliberately short-lived relative to the business process it represents (an hour to a few days, not months). |
| `capability` | `string` | **Yes** | The exact capability (`intent.action`) this approval is scoped to — e.g. `"hubspot:deal-update"`. Prevents capability substitution (§8). |
| `resourceId` | `string` | **Yes** | The exact business object this approval covers, in the same identifier shape the capability's own `intent.parameters` carries (e.g. a HubSpot `dealId`) — not a wildcard, not a pattern. Prevents authorization transfer (§8). |
| `scope.field` | `string` | **Yes** | The name of the specific policy-evaluated fact this artifact attests to — e.g. `"amountChangeExceedsThreshold"`'s underlying quantity, or more precisely the delta itself, `"amountDeltaAbs"`. Exactly one fact per artifact — an approval is never a blanket "everything about this request is fine." |
| `scope.comparator` | one of `PolicyOperator` (`packages/policy/src/types/Policy.ts`) restricted to `eq`, `lte`, `gte`, `lt`, `gt`, `between` | **Yes** | Reuses the exact comparator vocabulary `PolicyEngine`'s own `OperatorEvaluator` already implements and this codebase already tests — no new comparison DSL. |
| `scope.value` | `number \| string \| { min: number; max: number }` (shape depends on `comparator`) | **Yes** | The bound being approved — e.g. `{ comparator: "lte", value: 50000 }` meaning "approved for an amount delta up to 50,000." |
| `constraints` | `Readonly<Record<string, JsonValue>>` | Optional | Reserved, additive extension point for future scope dimensions (e.g. a specific allowed target `dealstage`) not yet needed for the HubSpot case; absent by default. |
| `nonce` | `string` (UUID v4) | **Yes** | Single-use. Burned on first successful verification (§10) — reuses the existing `NonceStore` interface verbatim. |

### 7.2 Envelope fields (`SignedApproval`)

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `payload` | `ApprovalPayload` | **Yes** | The signed content, §7.1. |
| `signature` | `Signature` (`packages/shared/src/domain/signature.ts` — `{algorithm, keyId, value, signedAt}`, reused verbatim) | **Yes** | Signature over the canonical serialization of `payload`. |

**Mandatory vs. optional, summarized:** every field in §7.1 is mandatory except `constraints`. There is no mandatory/optional distinction in §7.2 — both fields are always present in a well-formed artifact.

### 7.3 Trust boundaries

- The **issuer's signing key is never Parmana's own runtime key** (`FileKeyProvider`'s `DEFAULT_KEY_ID`). It is a separate keyspace, provisioned per-approver, verified against a small, explicit, server-side trust registry (§9) — the same shape of trust list `createConnectorAuthenticator.ts` already uses for trusted connector identities, applied here to trusted approval issuers instead.
- The **AI caller never holds or can construct a valid `SignedApproval`.** It can only attach an artifact it received out-of-band (from the approver) to its request; it cannot forge one (no private key), modify one (signature covers the full canonical payload), or manufacture one for a resource/amount it wasn't given (§8).
- **Parmana's runtime is a verifier of this artifact, not its issuer** — symmetrical to how `EnvelopeVerifier`/`AuthorizationVerifier` already verify artifacts Parmana itself did not sign (the receiving-system-independent-verification pattern `docs/CLAIMS.md` §2.9/§3.1 already establishes for the Execution Authorization itself, applied here in the *other* direction: Parmana is the receiver, an external approver is the issuer).

## 8. Canonical Serialization

Reused verbatim: `packages/crypto/src/CanonicalSerializer.ts`. `ApprovalPayload` is serialized via `serialize()` before signing and before verification — recursive key-sorting, `Date`-to-ISO-string normalization, UTF-8 encoding, identical to how `ExecutionAuthorizationPayload` and `RefusalRecord` are already serialized. No new serialization logic is specified or needed; this is a direct reuse, not an extension.

## 9. Signature Model

- **Algorithm:** either `ed25519` or `dilithium3` (ML-DSA-65/FIPS 204), per `packages/shared/src/config/CryptoAlgorithms.ts`'s existing `SignatureAlgorithm` type — an issuer may use either, exactly as `SIGNATURE_PROVIDER` already lets Parmana's own runtime choose either for its own signing. No new algorithm is introduced.
- **Signing:** `ArtifactSigner.sign(payload, issuerPrivateKey)` — reused verbatim; the *only* difference from how `AuthorizationSigner` uses it is *whose* private key is passed in.
- **Issuer key registry (new, small, precedented):** a server-side, explicit list — structurally identical to `createConnectorAuthenticator.ts`'s trusted-connector-identity list — mapping `(approverId, keyId) → publicKey`. Provisioning and rotation of this registry is deliberately **out of scope** for this design (§16, Open Questions) — this document specifies the artifact and its verification, not the issuer key management operational process, which is a distinct concern (analogous to how `KEY-MANAGEMENT.md` already separates key custody from the artifacts that key signs).

## 10. Verification Algorithm

Deterministic, fixed-order, no early return between independent checks (mirroring `AuthorizationVerifier.verify()`'s own stated no-timing-oracle discipline exactly):

```
function verifyApprovalArtifact(
  artifact: SignedApproval,
  request: { action: string; resourceId: string; requestedValue: JsonValue },
  trustedIssuerKeys: (approverId, keyId) => KeyObject | undefined,
  nonceStore: NonceStore,
  revokedApprovals: RevokedApprovalStore,   // §12
  now: Date,
): ApprovalVerificationResult {

  // 1. Version gate — fails closed first, exactly like AuthorizationVerifier.
  //    Not signature/secret-dependent, so short-circuiting here introduces
  //    no timing oracle (identical reasoning to the existing verifier).
  if (artifact.payload.version !== 1) {
    return { valid: false, checks: { versionSupported: false, ... rest: false } };
  }

  // 2. Every remaining check runs unconditionally, in this fixed order,
  //    with no early return between them.
  const publicKey = trustedIssuerKeys(artifact.payload.issuer.approverId, artifact.payload.issuer.keyId);
  const signatureVerified = publicKey !== undefined
    ? await SignatureVerifier.verify(artifact.payload, artifact.signature, publicKey)
    : false;   // an unresolvable issuer is a verification failure, not a distinct error path

  const notExpired = now.getTime() < Date.parse(artifact.payload.expiresAt);

  const notRevoked = !(await revokedApprovals.isRevoked(artifact.payload.approvalId));

  const capabilityMatches = artifact.payload.capability === request.action;

  const resourceMatches = artifact.payload.resourceId === request.resourceId;

  const scopeSatisfied = OperatorEvaluator.evaluate(
    request.requestedValue,
    artifact.payload.scope.comparator,
    artifact.payload.scope.value,
  );

  // 3. Nonce consumption is attempted LAST, and only recorded as the
  //    deciding factor once every other check has already independently
  //    passed -- mirroring ExecutionGateway's own "nonce consumption
  //    attempted only after every other check passes" ordering exactly
  //    (see docs/CLAIMS.md 2.21's isSoleFailureNonceReplay reasoning).
  //    An artifact that fails on any other ground never burns its nonce,
  //    preserving a legitimate retry with a corrected request.
  const priorChecksPassed =
    signatureVerified && notExpired && notRevoked && capabilityMatches && resourceMatches && scopeSatisfied;

  const nonceUnseen = priorChecksPassed
    ? await nonceStore.checkAndRecord(artifact.payload.nonce, artifact.payload.expiresAt)
    : false;

  return {
    valid: priorChecksPassed && nonceUnseen,
    checks: {
      versionSupported: true,
      signatureVerified,
      notExpired,
      notRevoked,
      capabilityMatches,
      resourceMatches,
      scopeSatisfied,
      nonceUnseen,
    },
  };
}
```

**Every result is deterministic:** the same `(artifact, request, trustedIssuerKeys, now)` input always produces the same `checks` object (nonce/revocation state aside, which are the intentional, explicit, stateful exceptions any single-use or revocable primitive must have — identical in kind to the existing `NonceStore`'s own state-dependent determinism).

## 11. Security Properties

| Property | How the artifact prevents it | Evidence/reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Forged authorization | `signatureVerified` requires a valid signature under a *registered, trusted* issuer key — the AI holds no such key | §9, §10 step 2 |
| Modified authorization | Signature covers the full canonical serialization of `payload`; any bit-flip (amount, resourceId, capability, expiry) invalidates it | §8, existing `SignatureVerifier` semantics, unchanged |
| Capability substitution | `capabilityMatches`: `payload.capability` must equal `request.action` exactly | §10 step 2 |
| Scope escalation | `scopeSatisfied`: the *actual* requested value (derived from `intent.parameters`, not the caller's own declared signal) must satisfy `payload.scope`'s bound | §10 step 2 — critically, this reuses the same "compare against the real executed value, not the caller's claim" discipline `SignalIntentBinder` already established |
| Amount modification | Same as scope escalation — `scope.value`'s numeric bound is checked against the real amount that would execute | §10 step 2 |
| Replay | `nonceUnseen`: burn-on-first-successful-use via the existing `NonceStore` interface | §10 step 3 |
| Stale authorization | `notExpired`: `expiresAt` checked against `now` | §10 step 2 |
| Duplicate authorization | Same mechanism as replay — a second attempt with the same `approvalId`/`nonce` fails `nonceUnseen` | §10 step 3 |
| Authorization transfer (to another business object) | `resourceMatches`: `payload.resourceId` must equal the request's real resource identifier exactly | §10 step 2 |

## 12. Lifecycle

```
Authorization Request
    ↓  (a human/business process, outside Parmana, decides an over-threshold
    ↓   change should be permitted for a specific deal/amount)
Approval
    ↓  (the approver — a human role or business system with a registered
    ↓   signing key — decides to grant it, scoped to one capability, one
    ↓   resourceId, one bounded fact)
Artifact Creation
    ↓  (an ApprovalPayload is constructed: version, approvalId, issuer,
    ↓   issuedAt, a short expiresAt, capability, resourceId, scope, nonce)
Signing
    ↓  (ArtifactSigner.sign(payload, issuerPrivateKey) -- reused verbatim, §9)
Storage
    ↓  (the signed artifact is handed to whatever system will submit the
    ↓   Business Transaction -- out of scope how; Parmana does not store
    ↓   unconsumed artifacts, mirroring how it does not store unconsumed
    ↓   Execution Authorizations either)
Distribution
    ↓  (the artifact reaches the AI/caller through whatever channel the
    ↓   approval workflow uses -- out of scope for this design, §16)
Verification
    ↓  (§10's algorithm runs as part of policy/signal verification,
    ↓   integrated as described in §13, before the provisional decision
    ↓   is finalized)
Execution
    ↓  (unchanged -- the connector executes exactly as it does today,
    ↓   using intent.parameters, never the artifact itself)
Consumption
    ↓  (the nonce is burned at the moment §10's algorithm returns valid;
    ↓   a second presentation of the same artifact fails nonceUnseen)
Expiration
    ↓  (an artifact whose expiresAt has passed fails notExpired regardless
    ↓   of whether it was ever consumed)
Revocation
    (an operator may add approvalId to the RevokedApprovalStore, §14,
     at any point before consumption -- a revoked artifact fails notRevoked
     even if unexpired and unconsumed)
```

Every state transition above is a **verification-time check** (§10), not a stateful workflow Parmana itself drives — Parmana never initiates, approves, or distributes an artifact; it only verifies one presented to it, exactly as it already does for the Execution Authorization it *does* issue (the direction is simply reversed: there, Parmana is issuer and a receiving system is verifier; here, an external approver is issuer and Parmana is verifier).

## 13. Repository Integration

**Integration points only — no existing component is redesigned:**

- **`RuntimeEngine`:** a new, optional, trailing constructor parameter (exactly the established pattern from RFC-0021's `RefusalRecordBuilder`, RFC-0022's `SignalStateVerifier`, and TD-22's `CapabilityPolicyBinder`) — e.g. `approvalVerifier?: ApprovalVerifier`. When a policy rule's fact depends on an artifact-backed field (identified by a new, analogous opt-in policy declaration, mirroring `boundSignals`'s own opt-in shape), `RuntimeEngine.execute()` would look up the field's real value via this verifier before `PolicyEngine.evaluate()` runs — architecturally the same insertion point TD-22's `CapabilityPolicyBinder` already uses (after policy load, before `SignalIntentBinder`).
- **`PolicyEngine`:** untouched. It continues to evaluate whatever `signals` object it is given — the artifact-verification step would *populate* `signals.preAuthorizedForAmountChange` (or an equivalent) from a verified artifact instead of trusting the caller's own declared value, exactly as `SignalStateVerifier` already overrides caller-declared signals with independently-derived ones today.
- **`ExecutionGateway`:** untouched. The artifact is verified *before* the Gateway's own authorization/nonce/signature checks run (it is a policy-evaluation-time concern, not an execution-gateway-time concern) — a structurally separate trust boundary from the Execution Authorization the Gateway already verifies.
- **Replay Protection (`NonceStore`):** reused, not modified. A new, logically separate nonce namespace (or a new Supabase table mirroring `consumed_nonces`'s exact primary-key-as-atomicity shape) is required so artifact nonces cannot collide with or be confused with Gateway authorization nonces — an operational detail (§16), not an interface change.
- **Capability Registry:** untouched. `ConnectorRegistry`/`GatewayConnectorRegistry` have no awareness of this artifact at all — it is consumed entirely within the policy-evaluation stage, upstream of connector resolution.
- **Audit Pipeline:** extended, not redesigned — an `ExecutionAuditSink`-shaped event (mirroring the existing `execution.completed`/`execution.rejected` events `SessionCredentialSecureConnector` already emits) should record every artifact verification attempt (`approval.verified`/`approval.rejected`, naming `approvalId`, `issuer.approverId`, and which check failed) — the same "audit every accept/reject outcome" discipline `docs/CLAIMS.md` §2.16/§2.19 already establishes for caller authentication.
- **Canonical Capability → Policy Binding (TD-22):** unchanged and unaffected — `CapabilityPolicyBinder` continues to enforce which policy governs a capability; this artifact is consumed *within* that already-correctly-selected policy's evaluation, one layer downstream.

## 14. Failure Semantics

Every failure fails closed — no path returns an approval on ambiguous or missing evidence:

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Missing artifact | Treated exactly as today's safe default (`preAuthorizedForAmountChange` absent → `false`) *unless* a future policy declares the artifact mandatory for a given rule, in which case its absence is itself a rejection, not a default |
| Expired artifact | `notExpired: false` → overall `valid: false` → ordinary policy REJECT, no rule evaluated on faith |
| Malformed artifact (fails schema validation before verification is even attempted) | Rejected before §10 runs at all, logged distinctly from "no artifact provided" for operator visibility, but has the identical policy effect (REJECT) |
| Invalid signature | `signatureVerified: false` → `valid: false` |
| Capability mismatch | `capabilityMatches: false` → `valid: false` — this artifact does not apply to this action, regardless of how well-formed or validly signed it otherwise is |
| Scope mismatch (wrong fact) | `scopeSatisfied` is evaluated against the *declared* `scope.field`; a policy consulting a different fact than the artifact covers cannot use it at all — a configuration-time, not runtime, concern (§16) |
| Amount mismatch (real amount exceeds `scope.value`'s bound) | `scopeSatisfied: false` → `valid: false` |
| Nonce reuse | `nonceUnseen: false` → `valid: false`, and — critically — the nonce is **never re-burned** by a failed attempt (§10 step 3 only calls `checkAndRecord` once every other check already passed), so a legitimate request that failed for an unrelated, corrected reason can still succeed on retry with the same artifact, exactly once |
| Revoked artifact | `notRevoked: false` → `valid: false`, checked independently of expiry (a revoked-but-unexpired artifact still fails) |

No failure mode above produces a fabricated approval, a fabricated Trust Record, or a fabricated Receipt — every failure is an ordinary `PolicyDecision` REJECT flowing through the exact same `ExecutionGate.enforce()` path every other rejection already does, unchanged.

## 15. Threat Model

| Threat | Assumption / trust boundary | Resistance |
|---|---|---|
| Malicious AI | The AI is assumed hostile by default (this is this project's entire premise) — it holds valid API credentials but no artifact-issuer private key | Cannot create, modify, or extend the scope of a valid artifact (§11); can only relay one it received unmodified |
| Compromised AI | Same trust boundary as malicious AI — compromise does not grant access to a key the AI never held | Identical resistance; the artifact's security does not depend on the AI's integrity at all, only on keeping the issuer's private key outside the AI's reach |
| Prompt injection | Out of scope for this artifact specifically (a cryptographic verification layer, not an input-sanitization layer) — assumed to already be addressed, if at all, upstream of this design, since prompt injection targets the AI's *decision-making*, not the artifact's cryptography | This artifact provides no protection against an AI *choosing* to submit a request it shouldn't (that remains policy's job); it only prevents the AI from fabricating evidence that such a request was pre-approved when it wasn't |
| Forged signatures | Same as forged authorization (§11) | Requires the issuer's private key, held outside the AI's and Parmana's runtime's reach |
| Replay attacks | Nonce burn-on-first-use (§10 step 3), same mechanism and same trust level as the existing `NonceStore` | Identical residual risk to the existing Execution Authorization nonce model — a persistent (not in-memory) store is required for fleet-wide single-use, exactly as `docs/CLAIMS.md` §3.2 already documents for that artifact; the same caveat applies here and is not a new risk |
| Stolen artifacts | An artifact is bearer evidence, like the Execution Authorization envelope already is — anyone holding a valid, unexpired, unconsumed artifact can present it | Bounded by short TTL (§7.1) and single-use (§10); a stolen-but-unused artifact is a real residual risk, identical in kind to a stolen Execution Authorization, not a new risk this design introduces |
| Race conditions | Nonce check-and-record must be atomic (the existing `NonceStore` contract already requires this); two concurrent requests presenting the *same* artifact must not both succeed | Directly inherited from the existing, already-proven atomic `checkAndRecord` contract (`packages/storage/src/supabase/SupabaseNonceStore.ts`'s own concurrent-race test, reused verbatim for a new namespace) |
| Duplicate execution | Covered by the existing `businessTransactionId` uniqueness guard (`DuplicateBusinessTransactionError`), entirely independent of this artifact | No change; this artifact does not weaken or duplicate that existing protection |
| Partial execution | Out of scope — this artifact is a pre-execution authorization gate, not an execution-atomicity mechanism; unaffected by and unrelated to partial-execution concerns elsewhere in the runtime |
| Capability substitution | §11 | `capabilityMatches` check |
| Policy substitution | Out of this artifact's scope — already closed structurally by TD-22's `CapabilityPolicyBinder`, unaffected by and independent of this design |

**Explicit assumptions:** (1) the issuer's private key is held and used by a party genuinely independent of the AI and of Parmana's own runtime — this design cannot verify *who* holds a key, only that a registered key was used; (2) the trusted-issuer-key registry (§9) is itself correctly and securely provisioned — this design specifies verification, not issuer-key operational custody (§16); (3) the artifact's distribution channel (§12, "Distribution") is not compromised in a way that lets the AI obtain an artifact scoped to a request it should not make — this is an operational, not cryptographic, concern, explicitly out of this design's scope.

**Residual risks, named rather than implied:** a compromised or colluding *approver* (the human/system holding the issuer key) can validly authorize anything within their own signing authority — this artifact proves *an* authorized party approved something, not that the approval itself was wise or that the approver wasn't coerced; that is a business-process control outside this cryptographic design's reach, identical in kind to how a signed Execution Authorization proves Parmana's runtime approved a decision without proving the underlying policy was well-designed.

## 16. Verification Plan

Certification tests required before any implementation of this design could be considered complete — specified here so a future implementation phase has a concrete, pre-agreed bar, not specified vaguely and left to interpretation later:

- **Unit tests:** canonical serialization round-trips for `ApprovalPayload` (mirroring `CapabilityPolicyBinder.test.ts`'s own style); every field of §10's algorithm tested independently (version mismatch, expired, not-yet-valid signature, wrong capability, wrong resourceId, scope violated in each direction of each supported comparator, nonce reuse, revoked); a deterministic-output test asserting identical `(artifact, request, now)` inputs always produce identical `checks`.
- **Integration tests:** a full `POST /execute` HTTP-boundary test (mirroring `hubspot-deal-update.integration.test.ts`'s existing conventions exactly) proving an over-threshold amount change is rejected with no valid artifact, approved with one, and rejected again if the same artifact is replayed on a second request.
- **Architecture tests:** a `tests/architecture/`-style scan (matching this repository's existing `execution-boundary.test.ts` convention) proving the artifact-verification component is reachable from exactly one production integration point and that no alternate path can inject a "verified" fact without going through §10's algorithm.
- **Adversarial tests:** every threat named in §15 reproduced as a live-shaped test, matching this repository's own established convention (e.g. `SignalIntentBinder.test.ts`'s "blocks the exact live exploit" style) — a forged artifact, a modified amount bound, a capability-substituted artifact, a resource-transferred artifact, a replayed artifact, an expired artifact, a revoked artifact — each independently proven rejected.
- **Deterministic replay tests:** confirming the verification algorithm itself is side-effect-free except for the single, explicitly-scoped nonce burn (§10 step 3) — running the same well-formed artifact through verification twice without consumption (e.g. a dry-run/pre-check mode, if one is added) must not itself burn the nonce.
- **Cryptographic verification tests:** signature verification tested against both `ed25519` and `dilithium3` issuer keys (mirroring `dilithium3-cross-instance.test.ts`'s existing coverage of the same distinction for the Execution Authorization), and a cross-algorithm rejection test (an `ed25519`-signed artifact presented with a `dilithium3` key configured for that issuer, and vice versa) confirming `assertKeyType`'s existing fail-closed discipline extends here too.

**Success criteria, measurable:** 100% of the adversarial cases in §15 have a passing, named regression test; the full existing test suite (968 tests as of this phase, per Phase 2K/2L) continues to pass unmodified, proving no existing behavior regresses; `tsc -b` and the existing architecture-boundary suite remain clean.

## 17. Open Questions

Deliberately left unresolved by this design — decisions for the implementation phase, not inferred here:

1. **Issuer key provisioning and rotation process.** This design specifies *verification* against a trusted-issuer registry (§9); it does not specify how an approver is onboarded, how their key is generated/stored, or how rotation/offboarding works operationally.
2. **Distribution channel.** How a signed artifact physically reaches the AI/caller (embedded in the Business Transaction request body directly? a separate header? a reference id the caller resolves against a Parmana-hosted store?) is unspecified — a real design decision with API-shape consequences, deferred to implementation.
3. **Whether `constraints` (§7.1) needs concrete fields now or can remain a truly empty, reserved extension point until a second use case (beyond HubSpot amount changes) actually needs it.**
4. **Revocation store design** (`RevokedApprovalStore`, §10/§14) — this document assumes its existence and interface shape (`isRevoked(approvalId): Promise<boolean>`) but does not specify its storage backend, matching how this design generally specifies interfaces and leaves storage implementation to the future phase.
5. **Whether a single artifact should ever be allowed to cover multiple resourceIds or a range/pattern** — this design deliberately specifies exactly one `resourceId` per artifact (§7.1) as the safer default; whether a legitimate business need (e.g., "pre-approve any deal in this pipeline up to $X") justifies relaxing this is left open, not decided here.

## 18. Future Work

- Implement this design in a dedicated, separately-chartered phase, per this document's own instruction not to prototype or implement here.
- Implement the Razorpay Path A recommendation (§5) — a genuinely separate, smaller, non-artifact piece of work; scheduling it alongside or before this artifact's own implementation is a project-planning decision, not an architectural dependency (neither blocks the other).
- Revisit `payments:execute`'s five caller-asserted facts (§6's requirements matrix) once a real vendor-payment connector replaces the test-only `MockConnector` (TD-1) — this design's generality (capability/resourceId/scope, not HubSpot-specific fields) is intended to cover that future case without a second design phase, but this was not separately verified against vendor-payment's actual policy shape and should be re-checked when that connector is built.
- A future documentation-verification phase should address the stale `docs/CLAIMS.md` §3.4 citations Phase 2L flagged (§1, referencing this phase's own predecessor) — unrelated to this artifact, noted here only because it was surfaced in the same document chain.

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Every authorization requirement documented | ✓ — §6, extended from Phase 2L's own trace to include all 6 production capabilities, not only the 2 with confirmed gaps |

| Artifact schema completely specified (Path B finding only) | ✓ — §7, every field defined, mandatory/optional stated explicitly |
| Verification algorithm completely specified (Path B finding only) | ✓ — §10, fully deterministic, ordered, no early return between independent checks |
| Failure semantics deterministic | ✓ — §14, every failure named and fails closed |
| Threat model documented | ✓ — §15, assumptions, trust boundaries, and residual risks all stated explicitly, not implied |
| Integration points identified | ✓ — §13, integration points only; no existing component's architecture is redesigned |
| No production source code changed | ✓ — this phase produced only this document |
| No public API changed | ✓ — no route, schema, or field was modified; §17's Open Question #2 (distribution channel) explicitly defers any future API-shape decision |

## Final Recommendation

**DESIGN CERTIFIED** — for the HubSpot-class finding (Path B) specifically.

Repository evidence (§4) demonstrates the Razorpay daily-cumulative-cap finding does **not** require a new authorization artifact — it requires extending existing, already-signed, already-stored infrastructure (`ExecutionTrustRecordRepository`, `RazorpaySignalStateVerifier`) with a new query capability, correctly classified **DESIGN NOT REQUIRED** and left to a separately-recommended implementation phase (§5). Repository evidence equally demonstrates the HubSpot `preAuthorizedForAmountChange` finding **cannot** be closed by extending any existing verification component, because no existing artifact represents an attestation from a party independent of both the AI caller and Parmana's own runtime — this genuinely requires a new primitive (§4, §5). That primitive's design is complete: every mandatory field is specified (§7), canonical serialization and signing are fully reused from existing, proven infrastructure (§8, §9), the verification algorithm is fully specified and deterministic (§10), every named security property is demonstrated (§11), the complete lifecycle is specified (§12), integration points are identified without redesigning any existing component (§13), every failure mode fails closed (§14), the threat model is documented with assumptions and residual risks stated explicitly rather than implied (§15), and a concrete, measurable verification plan is specified for the future implementation phase to be held to (§16). Open questions (§17) are genuine implementation-phase decisions (key provisioning, distribution channel, revocation storage), not gaps in the architectural specification itself.
