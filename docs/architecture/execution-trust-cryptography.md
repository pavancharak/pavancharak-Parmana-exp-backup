\# Execution Trust Cryptography



\## Overview



Execution Trust Cryptography provides the cryptographic foundation of Parmana's Execution Trust Infrastructure.



It ensures that every authorization decision, execution, verification, and receipt can be independently validated long after execution has completed.



Rather than securing communication channels, this subsystem secures execution evidence.



\---



\# Purpose



Execution Trust Cryptography provides:



\* Integrity

\* Authenticity

\* Tamper Evidence

\* Independent Verification

\* Long-Term Auditability



Its purpose is to produce cryptographic proof that an execution occurred exactly as authorized.

Execution Trust Cryptography begins after execution has been authorized and continues through verification and receipt generation.

```



Every stage produces immutable evidence.



\---



\# Execution Trust Record



The Execution Trust Record is the primary cryptographic object.



It captures:



\* Execution Intent

\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Policy References

\* Decisions

\* Execution Evidence

\* Verification History

\* Receipts



The record becomes the canonical representation of execution.



\---



\# Canonical Serialization



Before any cryptographic operation, Parmana converts objects into deterministic byte sequences.



Canonical serialization guarantees:



\* Stable property ordering

\* UTF-8 encoding

\* Deterministic formatting

\* Platform-independent output



The same Trust Record always produces the same byte representation.



\---



\# Hashing



Canonical bytes are hashed to produce immutable identifiers.



```text

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Canonical Bytes

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Hash Provider

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Trust Record Hash

```



Current implementation:



\* SHA-256



Future providers may include:



\* SHA3-512

\* BLAKE3



Hash providers are selected through configuration.



\---



\# Verification



Verification validates that the Trust Record satisfies Parmana's execution trust requirements.



Verification includes:



\* Structural validation

\* Policy validation

\* Evidence validation

\* Authority validation

\* Authorization validation

\* Integrity validation



Successful verification produces a verification result that becomes part of the immutable Trust Record.



\---



\# Receipt Generation



After successful verification, Parmana generates a cryptographic receipt.



```text

Verified Trust Record

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Receipt Builder

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Receipt Hash

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Signature Provider

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Execution Trust Receipt

```



Receipts are cryptographically signed attestations of successful verification.



\---



\# Signature Algorithms



Receipt signatures are algorithm independent.



Current implementations:



| Algorithm              | Status    |

| ---------------------- | --------- |

| Ed25519                | Supported |

| ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium3) | Supported |



Future implementations may include:



\* ML-DSA-87

\* SLH-DSA



The active provider is selected through configuration.



\---



\# Key Management



Signature providers never manage key storage directly.



Instead they obtain key material from the configured Key Provider.



Current implementation:



```text

FileKeyProvider

```



Future implementations:



\* AWS KMS

\* Azure Key Vault

\* Google Cloud KMS

\* HashiCorp Vault

\* Hardware Security Modules (HSM)



This separation allows cryptographic algorithms and key storage mechanisms to evolve independently.



\---



\# Independent Verification



Execution Trust Records and Receipts can be verified without access to the executing runtime.



Independent verification requires:



\* Canonical serialization

\* Public verification key

\* Supported signature algorithm

\* Receipt

\* Execution Trust Record



No database access is required to validate cryptographic integrity.



\---



\# Replay Compatibility



Replay uses the same canonical cryptographic model.



```text

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Replay Engine

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Canonical Serialization

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Hash Verification

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Receipt Verification

```



Replay validates that historical executions remain cryptographically consistent.



\---



\# Security Properties



Execution Trust Cryptography provides:



\* Integrity

\* Authenticity

\* Tamper Evidence

\* Deterministic Verification

\* Independent Validation

\* Long-Term Auditability

\* Algorithm Agility

\* Post-Quantum Readiness



It does not provide confidentiality or encryption. Those concerns belong to separate security layers.



\---



\# Design Principles



Execution Trust Cryptography is built on the following principles:



\* Cryptography protects execution evidence, not execution itself.

\* Canonical serialization precedes every cryptographic operation.

\* All cryptographic artifacts are deterministic.

\* Business logic is independent of cryptographic algorithms.

\* Cryptographic providers are replaceable.

\* Key management is independent of signature providers.

\* Verification must be independently reproducible.

\* Every receipt is a signed cryptographic attestation of a verified execution.



These principles allow Parmana to evolve its cryptographic implementations while preserving the stability and verifiability of the Execution Trust Infrastructure.
