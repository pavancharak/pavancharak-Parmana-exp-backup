# System Architecture

Canonical, implementation-derived overview of Parmana's architecture: what each package is responsible for, how a business action flows from HTTP request to audited receipt, and where the repository's architectural boundaries are enforced.

This document describes the system **as implemented**, verified against source as of Phase 1G. It does not describe intended or historical architecture. Where earlier design documents disagree with this one, this one — and the two documents it's built on — win:

- [`execution-pipeline-report.md`](./execution-pipeline-report.md) — the Phase 1E execution-graph baseline (call graph, ownership map, static search results).
- [`repository-invariants.md`](./repository-invariants.md) — the Phase 1F canonical list of automatically-enforced architectural invariants, with the exact test that enforces each one.

This document doesn't repeat their content; it's the entry point that ties them together with package responsibilities and the surrounding subsystems (authorization, signal verification, replay, audit) they don't individually cover end to end. For a class-by-class narrated trace of one request, see [`execution-walkthrough.md`](./execution-walkthrough.md). For how to extend the system safely, see [`../developer/extending-parmana.md`](../developer/extending-parmana.md).

## 1. Repository overview

Parmana is an authorization layer for AI-initiated execution: it sits between an AI system's *decision* to take an action (a payment, a CRM update, an API call) and the *business system* that actually performs it, and it guarantees that action only happens if it was policy-approved, signed, verified, and auditable — never on the AI's say-so alone.

The repository is an npm-workspaces monorepo (`packages/*`, plus `examples/` and `typescript/`). Each package under `packages/` is independently built (`tsc -b` via TypeScript project references) and independently tested (`vitest`).

## 2. Package responsibilities

| Package | Responsibility | Owns production execution? |
|---|---|---|
| `@parmana/shared` | Core domain types shared across the whole repo (`BusinessTransaction`, `ExecutionTrustRecord`, `ExecutableContent`, `ExecutionResult`, repository interfaces). No behavior, just contracts. | No |
| `@parmana/crypto` | Signing/verification/hashing primitives (Ed25519, Dilithium3/hybrid post-quantum, canonical JSON hashing) used to produce Authorizations, Trust Records, Receipts, and Refusal Records. | No |
| `@parmana/policy` | The Policy Engine: loads a `Policy`, evaluates signals against its rules, produces a `PolicyDecision` (APPROVE/REJECT). Also defines the `SignalStateVerifier` interface (§5) and `CompositeSignalStateVerifier`. | No |
| `@parmana/replay` | Deterministic reconstruction of a past execution from its Trust Record, for auditability. | No |
| `@parmana/receipt` | Cryptographically-signed Receipt generation once a Trust Record exists. Imports the `ExecutionPermit` *type* from `execution-control` to shape its model — no executable dependency. | No |
| `@parmana/storage` | Persistence: Postgres/Supabase and in-memory implementations of the repository interfaces `@parmana/shared` defines (`BusinessTransactionRepository`, `ExecutionTrustRecordRepository`, etc.). | No |
| `@parmana/envelope-verifier` | Signature/expiry/nonce verification primitives `ExecutionGateway` composes into its `verify()` sequence. | No |
| `@parmana/execution-system` | Defines the `ExecutionSystem` interface (`execute(request): Promise<ExecutionResult>`) — the seam `RuntimeEngine`'s pipeline calls through, and that `ExecutionGateway` implements. Also ships `DefaultExecutionSystem`/`HttpExecutionSystem` as alternate, non-production implementations of the same interface. | No |
| `@parmana/runtime` | `RuntimeEngine`: policy evaluation, signal/intent binding, signal-state verification, authorization signing, and pipeline orchestration (`RuntimeComponent` stages) up to calling the injected `ExecutionSystem`. `ExecutionTrustApplication` wraps this with accept → run → verify → receipt. **Never** imports `execution-gateway`, `connector-sdk`, or `connector-hubspot` — enforced (Invariant 4, `repository-invariants.md`). | No |
| `@parmana/execution-control` | `ExecutionControlService`, `SecureConnector` implementations (`SessionCredentialSecureConnector`), `ConnectorExecutor`/`ConnectorPolicy`/`CredentialVault` interfaces. The layer between `ExecutionGateway` and a concrete connector: session-scoped credential issuance, policy re-check, audit. Depended on only by `execution-gateway` and `api` — enforced (Invariant 6). | No — defines the seams; doesn't implement a vendor adapter itself |
| `@parmana/execution-gateway` | **Owns production execution.** `ExecutionGateway.execute()` is the sole production execution API (envelope verification → `ExecutionControlService` → adapter dispatch). Internally owns connector registration, credential-backed dispatch, and every vendor adapter (`GatewayRazorpayAdapter`, `GatewayHubSpotAdapter`, `GatewayHttpAdapter`) — none of which are part of its public API; callers use three factory functions instead (§7). Depended on only by `api` — enforced (Invariant 6). | **Yes — exclusively** (Invariant 2) |
| `@parmana/connector-sdk` | Passive SDK: capability constants, request/response DTOs, the `Connector`/`CredentialProvider` interfaces, `MockConnector` (test double), and Razorpay's capability/DTO/signal-verification definitions. Zero `fetch()` calls anywhere in its `src/` — enforced (Invariant 1). | No |
| `@parmana/connector-hubspot` | Same pattern as `connector-sdk`, scoped to HubSpot: capability constants, DTOs, signal-verification definitions. Zero `fetch()` calls — enforced. | No |
| `@parmana/api` | The HTTP application: routes, bootstrap/composition root (`packages/api/src/bootstrap/*`), webhooks. Composes every other package into a running server. Routes only ever call `ExecutionTrustApplication.execute(...)`; bootstrap only constructs, never calls `.execute(` — both enforced (Invariant 5). | No (composes, doesn't execute) |

**The one documented exception:** `packages/api/src/webhooks/RazorpaySettlementProcessor.ts` calls a connector's `.execute()` directly — a read-only fetch-verify of a webhook's claimed settlement state, not business-action execution. See Invariant 3 in `repository-invariants.md` for the full rationale and its exact allowlist entry.

## 3. The execution pipeline

One production execution pipeline exists, permanently enforced by `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` (Invariants 1–6):

```
HTTP request
  → packages/api/src/routes/{execute.ts, transactions.ts}
      → ExecutionTrustApplication.execute()        (packages/runtime/src/ExecutionTrustApplication.ts)
          → Runtime.execute()                       (packages/runtime/src/Runtime.ts)
              → RuntimeEngine.execute()              (packages/runtime/src/RuntimeEngine.ts)
                  [policy evaluation, signal verification, authorization — see §4/§5]
                  → RuntimePipeline: TrustChainValidationComponent → ExecutionComponent
                      → ExecutionComponent.execute()
                          → (injected) ExecutionSystem.execute()
                              → ExecutionGateway.execute()                (packages/execution-gateway/src/ExecutionGateway.ts)
                                  → ExecutionControlService.execute()      (packages/execution-control/src)
                                      → SecureConnector.execute()          (SessionCredentialSecureConnector)
                                          → SdkConnectorExecutor.execute() (packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution)
                                              → Connector.execute()        (GatewayRazorpayAdapter / GatewayHubSpotAdapter / GatewayHttpAdapter)
                                                  → Business System
                  → BusinessTrustPipeline.execute()  → ExecutionTrustRecord
          → VerificationService.verify()
          → ReceiptService.generate()
```

Full narrated walkthrough with exact method-call ordering (including where `hookRunner` callbacks fire): [`execution-walkthrough.md`](./execution-walkthrough.md).

**Production binding:** `ExecutionSystem` is bound to `ExecutionGateway` exactly once, in `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createExecutionSystem.ts` — its own doc comment calls this "the single architectural entry point for execution-system composition." No other `ExecutionSystem` implementation is constructed in production bootstrap.

## 4. Authorization pipeline

Two independent signatures gate every execution:

1. **Runtime-issued Authorization** — `RuntimeAuthorizationSigner.sign()` (inside `RuntimeEngine.execute()`), only reached after `ExecutionGate.enforce(decision)` passes (i.e., only for an `APPROVED` policy decision). Binds a `decisionId`, `businessTransactionId`, `policyName`/`policyVersion`, and the exact `ExecutableContent` about to be released, with a TTL.
2. **Gateway-verified envelope** — `ExecutionGateway.verify()` independently re-checks, in order: protocol version, signature, expiry, TTL-vs-policy, business-transaction content hash (the frozen `ExecutableContent` must hash-match what was signed), and nonce-unseen (replay protection, §5). Only if every side-effect-free check passes does it consume the nonce; only then does it proceed to `ExecutionControlService`.
3. **Gateway attestation, per call** — `ExecutionControlService` re-authenticates the Gateway itself (`authenticator.authenticateGateway(...)`) before resolving a connector, and `SessionCredentialSecureConnector` issues a one-time, capability-scoped session before a credential is ever handed to a connector.

No stage trusts a decision made by an earlier stage without re-verifying its own concern — the Gateway doesn't trust that Runtime's authorization was well-formed just because it exists; it re-verifies the signature and content hash itself.

## 5. Signal verification

Two distinct mechanisms guard against a caller supplying signals that don't reflect reality, both inside `RuntimeEngine.execute()`, both running *before* authorization is ever signed:

- **Signal/Intent binding** (`SignalIntentBinder.findViolations`, `@parmana/policy`) — runs before policy evaluation. Proves the declared signals describe the *same action* as the Intent about to be authorized (closes the gap where a small, verifiable signals payload could be paired with an Intent that silently targets something else). A violation is treated as an ordinary policy REJECT.
- **Signal/State verification** (`SignalStateVerifier.findViolations`, optional, wired via `RuntimeBuilder.withSignalStateVerifier`) — runs only when the provisional decision is APPROVE. Independently re-fetches real state from the vendor (`RazorpaySignalStateVerifier`/`HubSpotSignalStateVerifier`, via `executeRazorpayCapability`/`executeHubSpotCapability`, which sign a fresh authorization and call the *same* injected `ExecutionSystem`/`ExecutionGateway` — not a separate path) and overrides the decision to REJECT on mismatch. A REJECT here means **no authorization is ever generated** — this is why a policy denial makes zero calls to the external system for ordinary rejections, but does make one for a state-mismatch check on an otherwise-approved decision.

Production wiring: `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createRazorpaySignalStateVerifier.ts` / `createHubSpotSignalStateVerifier.ts`, composed via `CompositeSignalStateVerifier` (`@parmana/policy`), threaded into `RuntimeFactory.create()`'s `signalStateVerifier` parameter.

## 6. Replay protection

Nonce-based, enforced inside `ExecutionGateway.verify()` (`GatewayVerificationResult.checks.nonceUnseen`): the nonce is checked last, and only consumed once every side-effect-free check (signature, expiry, TTL, content hash) has already passed — so a request that fails on some other ground never burns its nonce, but a request replayed with an already-consumed nonce is rejected before it can reach `ExecutionControlService`. Backed by `@parmana/envelope-verifier`'s `NonceStore` (in-memory for tests/examples, a durable store in production).

## 7. Audit generation

Two independent audit trails, at two different layers, for two different purposes:

- **Execution-control audit** — `ExecutionControlService` and `SessionCredentialSecureConnector` write to the shared `ExecutionAuditSink` on session creation, credential acquisition, and execution completion (see `ExecutionAuditEvent`, `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-runtime/types.ts` — the interface; the live implementation is production-configured, not the dead `connector-runtime/MemoryExecutionAuditSink`). One sink per registry — `GatewayConnectorRegistry.register()` requires it unless a connector explicitly opts into `legacyInsecure`.
- **Trust Record / Receipt** — the durable, signed evidentiary artifacts: `BusinessTrustPipeline` assembles the `ExecutionTrustRecord` from the runtime context after the pipeline completes; `ReceiptService.generate()` produces a signed `Receipt` from it. Refused (non-approved) decisions get their own signed, third-party-verifiable `RefusalRecord` instead (RFC-0021), written by `RefusalRecordBuilder` before `ExecutionGate.enforce()` is called — a refusal is evidenced even though nothing downstream of it ever executes.

## 8. Dependency graph

Verified acyclic (Phase 1F, Invariant 6 — `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`'s package-level ownership checks; also `npx tsc -b`'s project-reference build order, which fails on a cycle by construction):

```
shared          →  (everything else depends on this; depends on nothing internal)
crypto          →  shared
policy          →  shared, crypto                              (never depends on runtime — enforced)
envelope-verifier → shared, crypto
execution-system → shared
receipt         → execution-control (type-only), execution-system, shared
runtime         → policy, shared, crypto, execution-system      (never execution-gateway/connector-*  — enforced)
execution-control → shared, crypto                               (no dependents outside execution-gateway/api — enforced)
connector-sdk   → crypto, envelope-verifier, execution-system, policy, shared
connector-hubspot → connector-sdk, crypto, envelope-verifier, execution-system, policy, shared
execution-gateway → connector-sdk, connector-hubspot, crypto, envelope-verifier, execution-control, execution-system, shared
api             → everything (the composition root)
```

Note the direction: `execution-gateway` depends on `connector-sdk`/`connector-hubspot` (for capability constants and DTOs), never the reverse — this is what makes Invariant 1/2 (connector packages own no execution) structurally coherent rather than just a naming convention.

## 9. Extension model

See [`../developer/extending-parmana.md`](../developer/extending-parmana.md) for the full guide. Summary: new vendor integrations are added *inside* `execution-gateway` (a new `Gateway*Adapter` implementing `connector-sdk`'s `Connector` interface, registered via `createGatewayConnectorRegistry()`), never inside a connector package directly — that boundary is what Invariants 1 and 2 permanently enforce. New capabilities, signal verifiers, and policies each have a narrower, package-local extension point; components that must never be modified directly (the pipeline's core stages, `ExecutionGateway.execute()`'s verification sequence, the credential-handling seam) are listed explicitly there.
