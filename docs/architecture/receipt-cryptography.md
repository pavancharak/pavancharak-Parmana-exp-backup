\# Receipt Cryptography



\## Overview



Receipts are cryptographic attestations that prove an Execution Trust Record has been successfully verified.



A receipt contains:



\* Receipt metadata

\* Canonical receipt hash

\* Trust Record hash

\* Digital signature

\* Signature algorithm



Receipts provide tamper-evident proof that an execution has been authorized, verified, and recorded.



\---



\# Purpose



A receipt serves four purposes:



\* Prove the integrity of an Execution Trust Record.

\* Provide a cryptographic signature from Parmana.

\* Enable independent verification.

\* Produce long-term audit evidence.



\---



\# Receipt Structure



```text

Receipt

│

├── receiptId

├── businessTransactionId

├── trustRecordHash

├── receiptHash

├── issuedAt

├── algorithm

└── signature

```



Every receipt is immutable after creation.

\# Receipt Generation Pipeline



```text

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Canonical Serialization

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

TrustRecordHasher

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

ReceiptHasher

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

ReceiptSigner

&#x20;          │

&#x20;          ▼

Receipt

```



Each stage has a single responsibility.



\---



\# Canonical Serialization



Before hashing, Parmana converts the receipt into a deterministic representation.



Requirements:



\* Stable property ordering

\* UTF-8 encoding

\* No formatting differences

\* No runtime-dependent serialization



Every compliant implementation must produce identical bytes for identical receipts.



\---



\# Receipt Hash



The receipt hash protects the receipt contents.



```text

Receipt

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Canonical Bytes

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Hash Provider

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

receiptHash

```



The hash provider is configurable.



Current implementation:



\* SHA-256



Future implementations:



\* SHA3-512

\* BLAKE3



\---



\# Digital Signature



The canonical receipt is digitally signed.



```text

receiptHash

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Signature Provider

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

signature

```



Supported providers:



\* Ed25519

\* ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium3)



The selected provider is determined by configuration.



\---



\# Receipt Fields



| Field                 | Description                        |

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| receiptId             | Unique receipt identifier          |

| businessTransactionId | Business transaction reference     |

| trustRecordHash       | Hash of the Execution Trust Record |

| receiptHash           | Hash of the canonical receipt      |

| issuedAt              | Receipt creation timestamp         |

| algorithm             | Signature algorithm                |

| signature             | Base64-encoded digital signature   |



\---



\# Verification



Receipt verification performs the following steps:



```text

Receipt

&#x20;    │

&#x20;    ▼

Canonical Serialization

&#x20;    │

&#x20;    ▼

Receipt Hash

&#x20;    │

&#x20;    ▼

Signature Verification

&#x20;    │

&#x20;    ▼

Verified / Invalid

```



Verification succeeds only if:



\* The receipt has not been modified.

\* The receipt hash matches.

\* The signature is valid.

\* The configured public key verifies the signature.



\---



\# Algorithm Independence



Receipt generation is independent of the underlying signature algorithm.



Changing:



```dotenv

SIGNATURE\_PROVIDER=ed25519

```



to



```dotenv

SIGNATURE\_PROVIDER=dilithium3

```



changes only the cryptographic implementation.



The receipt generation workflow remains identical.



\---



\# Security Properties



Receipts provide:



\* Integrity

\* Authenticity

\* Tamper evidence

\* Independent verification

\* Non-repudiation (subject to key management)



Receipts do not encrypt data. Their purpose is to prove integrity and origin.



\---



\# Design Principles



Receipt cryptography follows these principles:



\* Deterministic serialization

\* Immutable receipt structure

\* Algorithm-independent business logic

\* Pluggable cryptographic providers

\* Persistent signing keys

\* Verifiable audit evidence



These principles ensure that receipts remain trustworthy regardless of the cryptographic algorithm selected by the deployment.
