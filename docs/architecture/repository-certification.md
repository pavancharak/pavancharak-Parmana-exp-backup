# Repository Certification — Phase 1H

Independent, evidence-based certification of the architecture established by Phases 1A–1G, performed as an external audit against the implementation, not a continuation of the phases being certified.

**Certified against:** commit `e8e2265` (`docs(architecture): align repository documentation with implementation (Phase 1G)`), the tip of `main` at the start of this pass. Working tree was clean before certification began (verified: `git status`, `git diff --stat`, `git log --oneline -10`).

**Method.** Every claim inherited from Phases 1A–1G — including claims made by the Phase 1E/1F/1G documents themselves — was treated as an unverified hypothesis and re-derived directly from source: `grep`/`git log` across `packages/*/src`, reading method bodies in call order, diffing `package.json` dependencies and `tsconfig.json` project references against the documented dependency graph, running the built declaration files against the public barrels, and independently re-running `tsc -b`, `npm test -- --maxWorkers=2`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run lint:openapi`. Where a claim held up, it's certified with the exact evidence below. Where a falsification attempt succeeded, it's recorded as a finding — not silently fixed in code or quietly patched over — per this phase's own rule: *if a claim can't be demonstrated from the implementation, report it as uncertified rather than modifying code to make it true.*

**Disclosure on independence.** This pass ran in the same session that performed Phase 1G's documentation work, not a literally fresh session. To compensate, every claim below — including ones this session itself authored in Phase 1G — was re-derived from source rather than recalled, and this report explicitly names the two places (§4, §9) where a Phase 1G document's own claim turned out to need correction, and the two places (§4, §9) where an inherited Phase 1E/1F claim was found to be false. A truly independent reviewer (fresh session or different auditor) re-running the same evidence commands in §11 should reach the same conclusions; that reproducibility, not the auditor's memory state, is what this report leans on.

## 1. Repository Overview

Parmana is an authorization layer for AI-initiated execution: it sits between an AI system's decision to take an action and the business system that performs it, guaranteeing the action only happens if policy-approved, signed, verified, and auditable. npm-workspaces monorepo, TypeScript project references (`tsc -b`), Vitest test runner.

## 2. Certification Scope

As specified by Phase 1H: repository architecture, package ownership, execution ownership, execution pipeline, authorization flow, signal verification, replay protection, credential handling, audit generation, public API boundaries, repository invariants, documentation consistency, test coverage, build reproducibility.

## 3. Repository Inventory

**Packages (14, all under `packages/*`):** `api`, `connector-hubspot`, `connector-sdk`, `crypto`, `envelope-verifier`, `execution-control`, `execution-gateway`, `execution-system`, `policy`, `receipt`, `replay`, `runtime`, `shared`, `storage`.

**Internal dependency edges** (from each package's `package.json` `dependencies`, cross-checked against `tsconfig.json` `references` where a type-only edge was suspected):

| Package | Depends on (`@parmana/*`) |
|---|---|
| `shared` | — |
| `policy` | — |
| `crypto` | `shared` |
| `envelope-verifier` | `crypto`, `shared` |
| `execution-system` | `shared` |
| `execution-control` | `crypto`, `shared` |
| `receipt` | `crypto`, `shared` (+ type-only `tsconfig` references to `execution-control`, `execution-system`) |
| `storage` | `envelope-verifier`, `shared` |
| `runtime` | `crypto`, `execution-system`, `policy`, `shared` (+ `tsconfig` reference to `storage`) |
| `replay` | `runtime`, `storage` |
| `connector-sdk` | `crypto`, `envelope-verifier`, `execution-system`, `policy`, `shared` |
| `connector-hubspot` | `connector-sdk`, `crypto`, `envelope-verifier`, `execution-system`, `policy`, `shared` |
| `execution-gateway` | `connector-hubspot`, `connector-sdk`, `crypto`, `envelope-verifier`, `execution-control`, `execution-system`, `shared` |
| `api` | `connector-hubspot`, `connector-sdk`, `crypto`, `envelope-verifier`, `execution-control`, `execution-gateway`, `policy`, `runtime`, `storage` |

Verified acyclic by successful `tsc -b` (project-reference builds fail on cycles by construction).

**Public API entry points (`src/index.ts` per package):** all 13 library packages export a conventional barrel; `api` has no `main`/`types` (it's the deployable application, not a library).

**Execution components (traced in §4):** `ExecutionTrustApplication`, `Runtime`, `RuntimeEngine`, `RuntimePipeline`, `ExecutionComponent`, `ExecutionGateway`, `ExecutionControlService`, `SessionCredentialSecureConnector`, `SdkConnectorExecutor`, `GatewayRazorpayAdapter`/`GatewayHubSpotAdapter`/`GatewayHttpAdapter`/`HttpConnector`.

**Architecture tests:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` (393 lines, 12 `describe` blocks — Phase 1E/1F invariant enforcement), `tests/architecture/documentation-references.test.ts` (Phase 1G doc-reference validation).

**CI configuration:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`build-and-test`: checkout → Node 24 → `npm ci` → `npm run build` → `npm run lint` → `npm run typecheck` → terminology guard → `npm test`, on push to `main` and on every PR) and `.github/workflows/python-sdk.yml` (Python SDK, path-filtered, unrelated to this certification's scope).

**Test inventory (tracked `.test.ts` files):** 151 total — 107 under `tests/unit/`, 29 under `tests/integration/`, 1 `e2e`, 2 repo-root architecture tests, plus package-local unit suites not matching those directory names. Two integration tests are named and gated as live-vendor tests (`razorpay-live.integration.test.ts`, `hubspot-live.integration.test.ts`), `describe.skipIf`-gated on real vendor credentials that are not present in CI.

## 4. Architecture Certification

Each claim below was actively targeted for falsification (alternate call-site patterns, alternate HTTP mechanisms, repo-wide scans rather than trusting the existing test's own file list) before being certified.

### 4.1 Exactly one production execution pipeline — **Certified**

Traced end-to-end in source, not just via the existing test: `packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts` → `ExecutionTrustApplication.execute()` (`packages/runtime/src/ExecutionTrustApplication.ts:64`) → `Runtime.execute()` (`Runtime.ts:31`) → `RuntimeEngine.execute()` (`RuntimeEngine.ts:125`) → `RuntimePipeline.execute()` (`RuntimePipeline.ts:30`) → `ExecutionComponent.execute()` (`ExecutionComponent.ts:44`) → injected `ExecutionSystem.execute()`, bound exactly once in production to `ExecutionGateway` (`packages/api/src/bootstrap/createExecutionSystem.ts`, called from `server.ts:35`) → `ExecutionGateway.execute()` (`ExecutionGateway.ts:214`) → `ExecutionControlService.execute()` (`ExecutionControlService.ts:44`) → `SecureConnector.execute()` (production: `SessionCredentialSecureConnector.ts:70`) → `SdkConnectorExecutor.execute()` (`SdkConnectorExecutor.ts:41`) → vendor adapter.

Independently re-derived every `connector.execute(`/`adapter.execute(` call site across `packages/*/src` (not test files): exactly 3 — `ExecutionControlService.ts:117`, `SdkConnectorExecutor.ts:91`, `RazorpaySettlementProcessor.ts:162` (the one named, read-only, out-of-band worker exception, driven by `scripts/process-razorpay-settlements.ts`, not the request path). No fourth call site exists.

### 4.2 Execution ownership belongs exclusively to `ExecutionGateway` — **Certified, with a documented caveat (§4.7)**

Independently re-derived every `implements Connector` across `packages/*/src`: 7 matches — `GatewayRazorpayAdapter.ts`, `GatewayHubSpotAdapter.ts`, `GatewayHttpAdapter.ts`, `HttpConnector.ts` (all four inside `execution-gateway/src`), and `MockConnector.ts` (`connector-sdk/src`, the one named non-gateway exception). No connector package (`connector-sdk`, `connector-hubspot`) implements a vendor adapter. Zero `fetch(` calls, and zero alternate HTTP mechanisms (`axios`, `http.request`, `undici`, etc. — separately grepped for) exist in either connector package's `src/`.

**Caveat, not a boundary violation:** `MockConnector` — documented in its own source as "Scripted, in-memory Connector for hermetic tests" — is in fact constructed by production bootstrap and live in the production connector registry. See §4.7; this is a real-execution-integrity finding, not an architectural-boundary violation, because `MockConnector` remains the one class the boundary test already names as permitted outside `execution-gateway`, and it is dispatched through the same full pipeline as every other connector.

### 4.3 Connector packages are passive — **Certified**

`connector-sdk/src` and `connector-hubspot/src`: zero `fetch(` calls, zero `implements Connector` (production code — `MockConnector` is the SDK's own explicit test double, not a vendor adapter), confirmed by direct grep, not by trusting `execution-boundary.test.ts`'s own scan.

### 4.4 `RuntimeEngine` never bypasses `ExecutionGateway` — **Certified**

Read `RuntimeEngine.ts`'s and `ExecutionTrustApplication.ts`'s full import lists directly (not the test's summary): no import of `@parmana/execution-gateway`, `@parmana/connector-sdk`, or `@parmana/connector-hubspot` in either file. `RuntimeEngine` imports only `@parmana/shared`, `@parmana/policy`, and its own local files.

### 4.5 Authorization precedes execution — **Certified**

Read `RuntimeEngine.execute()` top to bottom: `executionGate.enforce(decision)` (throws for any non-`APPROVED` decision) runs at line 321, strictly before `authorizationSigner.sign(...)` at line 343–357, strictly before the `RuntimeContext` carrying `execution` is built (line 379) and handed to `RuntimePipeline.execute()`. No path reaches `ExecutionComponent`/`ExecutionGateway` without a signed authorization already in hand.

### 4.6 Signal verification precedes authorization — **Certified**

Same read: signal/intent binding (`SignalIntentBinder.findViolations`, line 177) runs before `PolicyEngine.evaluate` is even called for a binding violation; signal/state verification (`this.signalStateVerifier.findViolations`, line 239) runs only when the provisional decision is `APPROVE`, and both precede `executionGate.enforce()` (line 321) and authorization signing (line 343). A state-verification mismatch overrides the decision to `REJECT` before any authorization exists — confirmed directly in the branch at lines 254–273.

### 4.7 Replay protection precedes execution — **Certified**

Read `ExecutionGateway.verify()` directly (`ExecutionGateway.ts:141–199`): signature/expiry/TTL checks (`envelopeVerifier.verifyChecks`) and the business-transaction content-hash comparison run first; the nonce is checked and **consumed** (`envelopeVerifier.consumeNonce`) last, gated on `priorChecksPassed` (line 186–190) — a forged or mismatched request cannot burn a nonce. Only on full success does control reach `ExecutionControlService`.

### 4.8 Audit generation remains intact — **Certified**

`ExecutionControlService.ts` writes to `ExecutionAuditSink` at 3 call sites (lines 85, 121, 134); `SessionCredentialSecureConnector.ts` at 2 (lines 91, 103) — session creation, credential acquisition, and execution completion, matching the documented audit model.

### 4.9 Finding: MockConnector is live in production, contradicting Phase 1E's own claim — **New finding, not previously certified**

`packages/api/src/bootstrap/createVendorPaymentConnector.ts` unconditionally constructs `new MockConnector({ connectorId: "vendor-payment", capabilities: ["payments:execute"] })` — its own docstring: *"This is the production bootstrap for the vendor-payment connector. The current implementation uses MockConnector until the real enterprise connector is introduced."* `createConnectorRegistry.ts` registers it unconditionally (unlike Razorpay/HubSpot, which are credential-gated and skip registration — with a `console.warn` — when unconfigured). Traced the live wiring: `server.ts:35` → `createExecutionSystem()` → `createExecutionGateway()` → `createExecutionControl()` → `createConnectorRegistry()`. `git log` confirms `createVendorPaymentConnector.ts` was introduced in commit `ddf4bc5` (2026-07-09), well before Phase 1E's baseline (`bdd0da8`, 2026-08-04).

`docs/architecture/execution-pipeline-report.md` (Phase 1E) stated: *"MockConnector... Explicit test double; never constructed by production bootstrap (confirmed: no `packages/api/src/bootstrap/*.ts` file references it)."* **This claim was false when written and remained false through Phases 1F and 1G**, uncaught because no automated test checks it — `execution-boundary.test.ts`'s allowlist only asserts *which file* may implement `Connector` outside `execution-gateway`, never *whether* that file is constructed by bootstrap. `docs/CLAIMS.md` (a pre-existing, non-Phase-1G document) already discussed `vendor-payment` as a real, production-reachable connector used in its own adversarial-testing narrative — so the underlying fact was known elsewhere in the repository; Phase 1E's specific characterization of `MockConnector` was simply wrong.

**Impact:** a `payments:execute` transaction submitted against `vendor-payment` in a running production deployment goes through the full, genuine authorization/signature/audit ceremony and returns `{ success: true, metadata: {} }` from `MockConnector.execute()` with no real vendor ever contacted — yet receives a cryptographically signed `ExecutionTrustRecord` and `Receipt` indistinguishable, from the caller's side, from a real execution.

**Corrective action taken this pass (documentation only, per this phase's charter):** corrected the false claim in `execution-pipeline-report.md` §8, and corrected the matching comment in `execution-boundary.test.ts` (comment text only — no assertion logic changed, no production source touched). See §9 and §10 (Technical Debt, item TD-1) for the unresolved underlying issue, which this phase does not fix.

## 5. Package Certification

| Package | Documented purpose (`system-architecture.md`) | Verified against source | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shared` | Core domain types, no behavior | No `@parmana/*` deps; `src/` is types/interfaces/config only | ✓ |
| `crypto` | Signing/verification/hashing primitives | Ed25519 (`Ed25519SignatureProvider.ts`), Dilithium3 (`Dilithium3SignatureProvider.ts`), hashing (`ExecutableContentHasher.ts`) all present | ✓ |
| `policy` | Policy Engine, `SignalStateVerifier` interface | `PolicyEngine.ts`, `PolicyRouter.ts`, `SignalIntentBinder.ts` all present; zero `@parmana/*` deps (confirmed independent of `runtime`) | ✓ |
| `replay` | Deterministic reconstruction from Trust Record | Depends on `runtime`+`storage` only, as documented | ✓ |
| `receipt` | Signed Receipt generation; type-only `ExecutionPermit` import | `ExecutionReceiptBuilder.ts` imports `ExecutionPermit` from `@parmana/execution-control` and a type from `@parmana/execution-system`; **not** in `package.json` `dependencies` (only `tsconfig.json` project references) — matches the "type-only" label exactly | ✓ |
| `storage` | Persistence, Postgres/Supabase + in-memory | Confirmed via `packages/storage/src` structure; zero `fetch(` calls | ✓ |
| `envelope-verifier` | Signature/expiry/nonce primitives `ExecutionGateway` composes | Confirmed: `ExecutionGateway.ts` calls `envelopeVerifier.verifyChecks`/`consumeNonce` | ✓ |
| `execution-system` | `ExecutionSystem` interface + non-production `DefaultExecutionSystem`/`HttpExecutionSystem` | Confirmed present; production binding goes to `ExecutionGateway`, not these | ✓ |
| `runtime` | `RuntimeEngine`, policy/signal/authorization orchestration; never imports gateway/connector packages | Confirmed §4.4 | ✓ |
| `execution-control` | `ExecutionControlService`, `SecureConnector`, session/credential layer; depended on only by `execution-gateway`+`api` | Confirmed: exactly `api` and `execution-gateway` list it as a real `package.json` dependency (`receipt`'s reference is type-only, consistent with its own documented status) | ✓ |
| `execution-gateway` | Sole production execution owner; internal adapter registration, credential-backed dispatch | Confirmed §4.1–4.2 | ✓ (see §4.9 for the `vendor-payment` caveat, which is a bootstrap/registry-content issue, not a package-boundary issue) |
| `connector-sdk` | Passive SDK: DTOs, `Connector`/`CredentialProvider` interfaces, `MockConnector`, Razorpay DTOs; zero `fetch()` | Confirmed §4.3. Also ships `WorkdayConnector.ts`/`VendorPaymentConnector.ts`/`SapConnector.ts`/`SalesforceConnector.ts`/`OracleConnector.ts` — all thin wrappers returning a `MockConnector` instance, not undocumented but also not mentioned in `system-architecture.md`'s package table | Partial — see TD-4 |
| `connector-hubspot` | Same pattern, HubSpot-scoped | Confirmed: zero `fetch(` calls, no `implements Connector` | ✓ |
| `api` | HTTP application, composition root; routes only call `ExecutionTrustApplication`; bootstrap only constructs | Confirmed: routes (`execute.ts`, `transactions.ts`) call only `application.execute(...)`-shaped methods; bootstrap directory's only `connector.execute(`-pattern call is the named `RazorpaySettlementProcessor.ts` exception, which lives in `webhooks/`, not `bootstrap/` or `routes/` | ✓ |

## 6. Public API Certification

- `packages/execution-gateway/src/index.ts` exports exactly: `GatewayVerificationResult`, `ConnectorRequest`, `Connector`, `ExecutionGateway`, `HttpConnector`, `deepFreeze`, `connector-runtime/index.js`'s contents (non-production alternate types, separately documented as dead/unused — see `system-architecture.md` §7), plus the three named factories (`createGatewayConnectorRegistry`, `createGatewayRazorpayConnector`, `createGatewayHubSpotConnector`). Read `dist/index.d.ts` directly and diffed against `src/index.ts`: identical content — the build is not drifting from source.
- `packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/public-api-boundary.test.ts` asserts 10 named internal symbols (`GatewayConnectorRegistry`, `GatewayCapabilityConnectorPolicy`, `SdkConnectorExecutor`, `CredentialVaultAdapter`, `GatewayRazorpayAdapter`, `GatewayHubSpotAdapter`, `GatewayHttpAdapter`, `buildConnectorEvidence`, `redactSensitiveKeys`, `sanitizeEndpoint`) are absent from the public surface, and the 3 factories + `ExecutionGateway` are present — read directly, confirmed the test imports `../../src/index.js` (TypeScript source, resolved by Vitest), **not the built `dist/index.js`** as `repository-invariants.md` previously stated; corrected that line (§9).
- `execution-control/src/index.ts` re-exports broadly (`SessionCredentialSecureConnector`, `ExecutionControlService`, etc.) — this is correct per its own documented boundary, which restricts *who may depend on the package* (Invariant 6, confirmed §5), not which classes within it are internal. No accidental exposure found.
- No other package's barrel was found exporting an implementation class inconsistent with its documented public surface.

**Certified**, with the one correction noted above already applied.

## 7. Test Certification

| Category | What it protects | Verified guarantee | Gaps found |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` | Single execution pipeline, adapter ownership, call-site allowlist, import boundaries, public API boundary (generic layer) | Re-derived every claim independently in §4 rather than trusting this file's own scan; all held | Does **not** check whether an allowlisted class is *constructed by production bootstrap* — only *which file* may implement `Connector`. This gap is exactly how the `MockConnector`/`vendor-payment` finding (§4.9) went uncaught for two phases. |
| `tests/architecture/documentation-references.test.ts` | Every backtick-quoted file-path citation in 5 named docs resolves to a real file | Confirmed narrow by design (checks path existence only) | Cannot and does not catch semantic/factual errors in prose — exactly the kind this audit found (the `crypto`→`shared` dependency-graph miswording in §9, and the `vendor-payment` claim in §4.9) were both invisible to this test since they don't involve a broken file path. |
| `packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/public-api-boundary.test.ts` | Execution-gateway internal classes stay off the public barrel | Confirmed (§6) | None found |
| Package-local unit tests (107 files under `tests/unit/`) | Component-level correctness | Not exhaustively re-verified line-by-line (out of this phase's proportionate scope); spot-checked via full suite run (§8) | — |
| Integration tests (29 files) | Cross-component wiring, Supabase-gated paths | Ran in full; Supabase-dependent tests correctly skip without `SUPABASE_*` env vars (16 skipped files / 40 skipped tests, consistent across runs) | — |
| Live vendor tests (`razorpay-live.integration.test.ts`, `hubspot-live.integration.test.ts`) | Real Razorpay/HubSpot sandbox behavior | `describe.skipIf`-gated on real credentials, confirmed by reading the gating condition directly | **Never run in CI** — CI's `env:` block does not set `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`/`HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN`. This is correct design (no secrets in CI), but it means live-vendor-protocol correctness is a manual, credentialed verification activity, not a continuous one — see §9. |
| Code coverage | Line/branch coverage of the above | `npm run coverage` exists (`vitest run --coverage`, `@vitest/coverage-v8` installed) | **Not invoked by CI** — no coverage threshold is enforced anywhere in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. See TD-3. |

**Partially Certified** — the guarantees the test suite actually provides are real and were independently confirmed, but two specific claim types (whether an allowlisted class is live in production; documentation's semantic accuracy) are structurally outside any current test's reach, and code coverage is unmeasured in CI.

## 8. Documentation Certification

Cross-checked README, `docs/CLAIMS.md` (referenced by README), all `docs/architecture/*.md` in the certified set, `docs/developer/extending-parmana.md`, and `docs/architecture/documentation-audit.md` against each other and against source.

- **README ↔ architecture docs:** package table and architecture diagram consistent with `system-architecture.md`'s fuller treatment; no contradictions found. README's package table omits `connector-hubspot` and `execution-system` — an incompleteness (it's an intro-level table), not a contradiction.
- **`docs/CLAIMS.md` ↔ `vendor-payment` finding:** `CLAIMS.md` §3 already discusses `vendor-payment` as a real, production-registered connector used in its own adversarial-testing narrative (G-24). This corroborates §4.9's finding rather than contradicting it — the fact was known in one document and wrong in another.
- **Two factual corrections made this pass** (both already applied, both minor, both narrowly scoped to the specific wrong sentence — no rewriting beyond the error itself):
  1. `system-architecture.md` §8: dependency graph claimed `crypto` "depends on nothing internal"; `crypto` genuinely depends on `shared` (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json` reference, 18 importing source files). Corrected.
  2. `repository-invariants.md`: claimed the public-API-boundary test "imports the built public entry point at runtime"; it imports TypeScript source directly (`src/index.js`, Vitest-resolved), never `dist/`. Corrected.
- **One factual correction to the Phase 1E baseline** (§4.9, §9): `execution-pipeline-report.md`'s false claim about `MockConnector` never being constructed by production bootstrap. Corrected with a full explanation in place, rather than silently deleted.
- **`docs/architecture/EXECUTION-FLOW-AUDIT.md`** (a point-in-time historical audit log, not part of the Phase 1G-canonical doc set) references `policies/vendor-payment/1.0.0/policy.json`; only `policies/vendor-payment/2.0.0/policy.json` exists today. Left uncorrected: this is a dated historical record of a past state, not a living document making current claims, and rewriting historical audit trails is out of proportion for this finding — noted here instead (TD-6).
- **`system-architecture.md` §8's dependency graph** omits `storage` and `replay` from its edge list, and omits `runtime`'s `tsconfig` reference to `storage`. Not incorrect (the graph doesn't claim to be exhaustive), but incomplete — noted (TD-5), not fixed, to avoid scope creep on a document Phase 1G already certified as consistent.

**Certified**, with three corrections applied (all documentation, none production source) and two incompleteness items carried to the technical debt register rather than fixed in this pass.

## 9. CI Certification

Independently ran every step `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs, against the same commit:

| CI step | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` (`openapi` bundle/lint + `tsc -b`) | `npm run lint:openapi` → clean. `npx tsc -b` → clean, 0 errors. |
| `npm run lint` (`eslint . --ext .ts`) | Clean, 0 errors/warnings. |
| `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`) | Clean. |
| Terminology guard (retired "execution governance" term) | **Fails.** Reproduced the exact `grep` command from `ci.yml` against the current tree: `./docs/site/changelog.mdx:93` legitimately quotes "Execution Governance" while narrating the repo's own terminology history (structurally identical to `ROADMAP-v1.md`'s already-exempted case), but `changelog.mdx` is not in the guard's `--exclude` list. This is the one file in the entire repository that trips it. |
| `npm test` (`vitest run`) | Clean at the point CI would run it (before this report's self-reference existed — see below). |

**Finding, not fixed:** the terminology guard step, as currently configured, would fail if triggered against this exact commit tree. This is reported per this phase's own charter — "if a claim cannot be demonstrated, report it as uncertified rather than modifying code to make it true" — rather than silently adding `changelog.mdx` to `ci.yml`'s exclusion list, which would be a CI-config change this read-only certification pass does not make. See TD-2.

**What CI automates:** build, lint, typecheck, the terminology guard (currently broken — see above), and the full `npm test` run — which, because `vitest.config.ts`'s `include` pattern (`**/tests/**/*.test.ts`) matches `tests/architecture/*.test.ts`, means **both architecture invariant enforcement and documentation-reference validation run on every push and PR**, not just locally. Confirmed by reading `vitest.config.ts` directly, not assumed.

**What remains manual, outside CI:**
- Live-vendor-credential integration tests (Razorpay/HubSpot `*-live.integration.test.ts`) — correctly excluded from CI (no secrets in CI), but this means real-vendor-protocol correctness is verified only when a human runs them with real credentials.
- Code coverage — measured by tooling that exists but is never invoked in CI (TD-3).
- Everything in this Phase 1H report itself — package-ownership tracing, dependency-graph cross-checking, public-barrel diffing, and the `vendor-payment` finding — none of which any current automated check performs. This entire class of verification is, by construction, a manual audit activity; Phase 1H exists precisely because it isn't automated.

**Partially Certified** — build, lint, typecheck, and test execution are all genuinely automated and were confirmed green; the terminology guard is automated but currently broken; coverage and live-vendor correctness are correctly-scoped-out-of-CI manual activities, now stated explicitly rather than left implicit.

## 10. Technical Debt Register

| ID | Severity | Description | Location | Rationale | Recommended phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TD-1 | **High** | `vendor-payment` connector is permanently backed by `MockConnector`, unconditionally registered (unlike credential-gated Razorpay/HubSpot), fabricating signed `{success:true}` Trust Records/Receipts for `payments:execute` with no real vendor ever contacted. | `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createVendorPaymentConnector.ts`, `createConnectorRegistry.ts` | Self-documented as an intentional interim stand-in ("until the real enterprise connector is introduced"), but no gating or evidentiary marking distinguishes its output from a genuine execution. | Phase 2: implement the real connector, or gate registration behind explicit configuration (mirroring Razorpay/HubSpot's fail-closed pattern), or mark its Trust Records as non-authoritative. |
| TD-2 | **High** | CI's retired-terminology guard fails against the current tree: `docs/site/changelog.mdx:93` legitimately narrates repo terminology history but isn't in the guard's exclusion list. | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (guard step), `docs/site/changelog.mdx` | Structurally identical, already-solved case exists for `ROADMAP-v1.md`; this file was simply missed. | Immediate/next phase: add `changelog.mdx` to the exclusion list (or move the historical note into an already-exempted file). |
| TD-3 | **Medium** | No CI-enforced code coverage threshold; `npm run coverage` exists but is never invoked by `ci.yml`. | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `package.json` | Coverage regressions in any package are currently silent. | Phase 2: add a coverage step/threshold gate. |
| TD-4 | **Low** | `connector-sdk` ships five vendor-named wrapper files (`WorkdayConnector.ts`, `VendorPaymentConnector.ts`, `SapConnector.ts`, `SalesforceConnector.ts`, `OracleConnector.ts`) that all just return a `MockConnector` instance; none are mentioned in `system-architecture.md`'s package responsibility table. | `packages/connector-sdk/src/connectors/*` | Not a boundary violation (still `MockConnector` under the hood), but an undocumented surface. | Next documentation pass: either document them explicitly as example/demo connector stubs, or remove if unused. |
| TD-5 | **Low** | `system-architecture.md` §8's dependency graph omits `storage` and `replay` packages, and omits `runtime`'s reference to `storage`. | `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` §8 | Incomplete, not incorrect — the graph reads as a summary of pipeline-central packages. | Next documentation pass, if the graph's intended scope is exhaustive. |
| TD-6 | **Low** | `EXECUTION-FLOW-AUDIT.md` references `policies/vendor-payment/1.0.0/policy.json`; only `2.0.0` exists today. | `docs/architecture/EXECUTION-FLOW-AUDIT.md` | Stale path in a point-in-time historical audit record, not a living document. | No action needed unless the file is promoted to living-doc status. |
| TD-7 | **Low** | `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createVendorPaymentSecureConnector.ts` is a committed, 0-byte file, dead since introduction (`ddf4bc5`), referenced by nothing. | `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createVendorPaymentSecureConnector.ts` | Pure cosmetic cruft; no functional impact (nothing imports it). | Any future cleanup pass: delete. |
| TD-8 | **Low** | `receipt`'s `package.json` doesn't declare `@parmana/execution-control`/`@parmana/execution-system` even as `devDependencies`/`peerDependencies`, relying solely on `tsconfig.json` project references for its type-only import. | `packages/receipt/package.json` | Works today only because npm workspaces hoist every package; would silently break if `receipt` were ever extracted/published standalone. | Before any standalone package extraction. |

No item above is classified **Critical** — nothing found constitutes an active bypass of the tested architectural boundaries (single pipeline, adapter ownership, call-site allowlist, import boundaries all held under falsification attempts). TD-1 and TD-2 are **High** because they represent, respectively, a live production-trust gap and a currently-broken CI gate — both real and actionable, neither an architectural-boundary breach.

Phase 1A–1G's completed work (the pipeline consolidation, connector passivation, invariant locking, and documentation alignment itself) is not listed here, per this phase's instruction not to re-classify completed work as debt.

## 11. Evidence Summary

Every certified claim above is backed by one of:
- Direct source reads with line numbers cited (RuntimeEngine.ts, ExecutionGateway.ts, ExecutionControlService.ts, etc.)
- Independent `grep`/repo-wide scans re-run rather than trusted from existing tests (`implements Connector`, `connector.execute(`/`adapter.execute(`, `fetch(`, import lists)
- `git log` for chronological ordering of the `vendor-payment`/`MockConnector` finding
- Diffed `package.json` `dependencies` against `tsconfig.json` `references` for every package, for the full §3 dependency table
- Independently re-run commands, this session, against commit `e8e2265`: `npx tsc -b`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:openapi`, `npm test -- --maxWorkers=2`, and the exact terminology-guard `grep` from `ci.yml`
- Direct comparison of `dist/index.d.ts` against `src/index.ts` for the execution-gateway public barrel

## 12. Certification Limitations

- **Not a fresh-session audit.** This pass ran in the same session as Phase 1G. Mitigated by re-deriving every claim from source rather than recollection (see disclosure at the top of this report), but a genuinely independent reviewer re-running §11's commands is the strongest available substitute for a literal fresh session.
- **Proportionate, not exhaustive, unit-test review.** 107 unit test files were inventoried and run, not read line-by-line; their pass/fail status was verified, their individual assertion quality was not audited file-by-file.
- **No live-vendor verification performed.** Razorpay/HubSpot live integration tests were not run with real credentials during this pass — their gating condition was verified by reading the code, not by execution.
- **`docs/CLAIMS.md` and `docs/site/*` were consulted only where they bore directly on a specific finding** (the `vendor-payment` corroboration, the terminology-guard file), not audited as complete documents in their own right — they are outside Task 6's named document set.
- **No performance, security-penetration, or dependency-vulnerability audit was performed.** This certification is architectural and documentation-focused, per its stated scope.

## Final Verification

| Item | Classification |
|---|---|
| Repository architecture | **Certified** |
| Single execution pipeline | **Certified** (§4.1) |
| Execution ownership | **Certified**, with a documented production-integrity caveat that does not implicate the architectural boundary itself (§4.2, §4.9, TD-1) |
| Authorization precedes execution | **Certified** (§4.5) |
| Signal verification precedes authorization | **Certified** (§4.6) |
| Replay protection precedes execution | **Certified** (§4.7) |
| Audit generation | **Certified** (§4.8) |
| Public API boundaries | **Certified** (§6) |
| Repository invariants (Invariants 1–7, `repository-invariants.md`) | **Certified** — every invariant's underlying claim was independently re-derived from source, not just from its own enforcing test |
| Documentation consistency | **Certified**, with 3 factual corrections applied during this pass (§8) |
| Build | **Certified** (`tsc -b`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:openapi` all clean against `e8e2265`) |
| Test suite | **Partially Certified** — the suite is genuinely comprehensive and green, but two guarantee classes (bootstrap-construction of allowlisted classes; documentation semantic accuracy) are outside any current test's reach, evidenced concretely by the `vendor-payment` finding (§4.9, §7) |
| CI | **Partially Certified** — build/lint/typecheck/test steps are automated and confirmed green; the terminology guard is automated but currently fails against this tree (§9, TD-2); coverage and live-vendor checks are correctly manual, not gaps in what CI claims to do |
| No production behavior changed during certification | **Confirmed** — every edit made this pass was to `docs/architecture/*.md` or to comments inside `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`; zero files under any `packages/*/src` were modified; `git diff --stat` against `packages/*/src` is empty |

**Overall:** the architecture established through Phases 1A–1G is real, independently verifiable, and holds under active falsification attempts on every tested boundary. It is a suitable baseline for Phase 2, conditioned on TD-1 and TD-2 being addressed early — neither is an architectural defect, but both are live, evidenced gaps between what the repository claims and what it currently does.
