The Runtime Engine is deterministic orchestration.



It does not perform transport handling.



It does not perform persistence.



It does not expose HTTP concerns.



It coordinates policy evaluation, authorization, execution, and trust record creation through explicit stages.

\---

\---



\# Stage 8 — Runtime Pipeline



\## File



```

packages/runtime/src/RuntimePipeline.ts

```



\## Responsibility



Execute Runtime Components in deterministic order.



The Runtime Pipeline contains no business logic.



Its only responsibility is to orchestrate Runtime Components sequentially.

\---



\## Execution Algorithm



Implementation



```

current = context



for each component



&#x20;   current = component.execute(current)



return current

```



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## RuntimeContext



Input



```

RuntimeContext

```



Output



```

RuntimeContext

```



Every Runtime Component receives the complete Runtime Context and returns the updated Runtime Context.



No component communicates directly with another component.



Communication occurs only through RuntimeContext.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Component Registration



Components are injected through the constructor.



The pipeline never creates Runtime Components.



This responsibility belongs to RuntimeFactory.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Audit Notes



The Runtime Pipeline is intentionally minimal.



It provides deterministic orchestration only.



It does not:



\- evaluate policy

\- authorize execution

\- execute connectors

\- generate receipts

\- verify trust



Those responsibilities belong to Runtime Components.



\---



\# Stage 9 — Trust Chain Validation Component



\## File



```

packages/runtime/src/components/TrustChainValidationComponent.ts

```



\## Responsibility



Validate the minimum trust requirements before execution may continue.



This component does \*\*not\*\* evaluate business policy.

\# Stage 11 — Execution System



\## File



```

packages/execution-system/src/ExecutionSystem.ts

```



\## Responsibility



Define the execution boundary between Parmana and external execution systems.



The Execution System is an abstraction.



It defines the contract that every execution implementation must satisfy.



Parmana never executes enterprise operations directly.



Instead, it delegates approved execution requests to an implementation of this interface.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Interface



```typescript

interface ExecutionSystem {

&#x20;   execute(

&#x20;       request: ExecutionRequest

&#x20;   ): Promise<ExecutionResult>;

}

```



\---



\## Input



```

ExecutionRequest

```



\---



\## Output



```

ExecutionResult

```



\---



\## Responsibilities



The Execution System is responsible for:



\- Accepting an approved Execution Request.

\- Executing the request against the configured execution target.

\- Returning an Execution Result.



It is \*\*not\*\* responsible for:



\- Policy evaluation.

\- Decision creation.

\- Authorization generation.

\- Trust record generation.

\- Receipt generation.

\- Verification.



Those responsibilities remain within the Parmana Runtime.



Status:



✅ Verified

\---



\## Audit Notes



ExecutionSystem is an interface.



It contains no business logic.



Concrete implementations determine how execution reaches enterprise systems.



This abstraction decouples Parmana's governance runtime from specific execution technologies.

\---



\## Audit Conclusion



The Runtime depends only on the `ExecutionSystem` interface.



Concrete execution behavior is supplied through dependency injection.



This allows Parmana to support multiple execution strategies without changing the Runtime.



\---



\# Stage 13 — Execution Gateway



\## File



```

packages/execution-gateway/src/ExecutionGateway.ts

```



\## Responsibility



The Execution Gateway is the production implementation of the

`ExecutionSystem` interface.



It is the final verification boundary before any request is released

to an external execution target.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Position in Architecture

\---



\## Responsibilities



The Execution Gateway:



\- verifies the signed authorization envelope

\- verifies executable content integrity

\- prevents replay attacks

\- freezes the executable payload

\- forwards only verified requests

\- rejects every failed verification



It does \*\*not\*\*:



\- evaluate policy

\- create decisions

\- create authorizations

\- generate trust records



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Verification Pipeline

Deep Freeze Transaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Connector / ExecutionControl

```



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Verification Order



The implementation performs verification in the following order.



1\. Envelope verification

&#x20;   - signature

&#x20;   - version

&#x20;   - expiry

&#x20;   - TTL



2\. Executable content hash verification



3\. Nonce consumption



4\. Release to execution



The nonce is intentionally consumed last.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Executable Content Verification



The gateway reconstructs the canonical executable content from the

Execution Request.



It independently hashes the reconstructed content and compares it to

the hash embedded in the signed Runtime Authorization.



If they differ:



```

Execution rejected

```



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Replay Protection



Replay protection is performed only after every deterministic

verification succeeds.



A failed request never consumes a nonce.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Immutable Release



Before forwarding execution:



```

deepFreeze(executableContent)

```



is applied.



The forwarded transaction becomes immutable.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Release Targets



Exactly one execution strategy is configured.



\### Connector Mode



```

Connector.execute(...)

```



\### Controlled Execution Mode



```

ExecutionControl.execute(...)

```



or



```

ExecutionChannel.release(...)

```



The gateway rejects configurations that attempt to use both.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Failure Behaviour



Every verification failure results in rejection.



The gateway returns detailed failure information including:



\- failed verification stages

\- hash mismatches

\- replay failures



No execution is forwarded.



Status:



✅ Verified



\---



\## Audit Notes



The Execution Gateway is the final mechanical enforcement point before

enterprise execution.



It converts Runtime Authorization into controlled execution.



It is the primary security boundary of the Parmana execution model.

\## Security Properties



The builder does not create executable content.



Instead it copies the already-approved intent together with the Runtime Authorization.



This ensures the Execution Gateway independently reconstructs the canonical executable content before verification.



Status



✅ Verified



\---



\## Audit Notes



The ExecutionRequest is intentionally minimal.



\## Security Properties



The builder does not create executable content.



Instead it copies the already-approved intent together with the Runtime Authorization.



This ensures the Execution Gateway independently reconstructs the canonical executable content before verification.



Status



✅ Verified



\---



\## Architectural Notes



`ExecutionRequest` is intentionally a \*\*transport object\*\*, not a domain object.



It is the canonical message exchanged between the Runtime and the Execution System.



The Execution Gateway independently reconstructs the canonical `ExecutableContent` from the `ExecutionRequest` before verifying its integrity and authorization.



This design ensures the Gateway verifies the actual execution payload rather than trusting serialized Runtime state.



Status



✅ Verified



\---



\## Audit Notes



The ExecutionRequest is intentionally minimal.



It contains only:



\- businessTransactionId

\- action

\- target

\- parameters

\- authorization



It does not contain:



\- Policy

\- Decision

\- RuntimeContext

\- ExecutionTrustRecord



This minimizes the data crossing the Runtime → Execution System boundary while preserving deterministic verification.

\## Security Properties



The builder preserves the execution outcome exactly as returned by the configured `ExecutionSystem`.



It performs no enrichment, filtering, or transformation beyond structural mapping.



This minimizes the risk of altering execution evidence before it becomes part of the Execution Trust Record.



Status



✅ Verified



\---



\## Architectural Notes



`ExecutionEvidence` is an immutable evidence artifact.



It is \*\*not\*\* the raw connector response.



Instead, it is the canonical evidence representation used throughout the Runtime and ultimately embedded within the `ExecutionTrustRecord`.



This decouples the internal trust model from connector-specific response formats.



Status



✅ Verified



\---



\## Audit Notes



The builder intentionally contains no business logic.



It converts an `ExecutionResult` into Parmana's canonical evidence model.



This provides a stable evidence contract regardless of which `ExecutionSystem` implementation produced the original result.

\## Security Properties



The Runtime Authorization Signer does not implement signing logic.



Instead it delegates all cryptographic operations to the shared

AuthorizationSigner.



This centralizes cryptographic behavior across:



\- Runtime Authorization

\- Execution Trust Records

\- Receipts



Status



✅ Verified



\---



\## Architectural Notes



The Runtime Authorization Signer is an orchestration layer.



Cryptography is implemented inside the crypto package.



This separation keeps Runtime independent from cryptographic algorithms,

allowing providers to evolve without changing Runtime orchestration.

\## Audit Notes



This class has a single responsibility:



create a SignedExecutionAuthorization.

No Runtime processing occurs until a Business Transaction has been:



\- validated

\- checked for uniqueness

\- persisted



This establishes a canonical transaction before policy evaluation begins.

\---



\## Security Properties



Verification is deterministic.



All checks execute regardless of earlier failures.



The resulting Verification artifact records every detected failure.



Status



✅ Verified

\## Architectural Notes



Verification is modeled as its own immutable domain artifact.



Rather than returning only a boolean, Parmana records a complete

Verification object containing:



\- verification identity

\- verification timestamp

\- verification status

\- verification message

\- verified trust record hash



This provides durable evidence that verification occurred and what it

verified.



Status



✅ Verified

\## Security Properties



The repository only loads policy definitions.



Validation occurs later in `PolicyValidator`.



Evaluation occurs later in `PolicyEngine`.



Status

\## Architectural Notes



`FilePolicyRepository` is a storage adapter implementing the

`PolicyRepository` interface.



The Runtime depends on the interface rather than filesystem-specific

behavior, allowing alternate implementations (database, object storage,

Git-backed repositories, etc.) without changing Runtime orchestration.



Status



✅ Verified

\## Audit Notes



Policy lookup is deterministic.



The repository resolves exactly one policy using:



\- name

\- version



No implicit "latest" resolution, version negotiation, or fallback behavior

exists in this implementation.

\## Regular Expressions



Regex matching is delegated to

\## Helper Functions



Internal helpers provide deterministic behavior for



\- type detection

\- no randomness

\- no I/O

\- no network access



Status



✅ Verified

\## Architectural Notes



OperatorEvaluator is intentionally isolated from policy traversal.



PolicyEngine decides \*\*which\*\* conditions to evaluate.



OperatorEvaluator decides \*\*how\*\* an individual condition evaluates.



This separation keeps comparison semantics independent from rule traversal.

\# Stage 27 — Decision Builder



\## File



```

packages/runtime/src/DecisionBuilder.ts

```



\## Responsibility



⏳ Pending Audit



Expected responsibilities



\- Build immutable Decision artifacts

\- Transform PolicyDecision into Decision

\- Capture decision metadata



Questions



\- Which fields are copied?

\- Is decisionId generated here?

\- Is timestamp generated here?

\- Is the BusinessTransaction embedded?

\- Are policy traces preserved?



Status



⏳ Pending

It supports nested logical expressions (`all`, `any`), simple leaf

conditions, and an unconditional `always` condition.



When no rule matches, the default decision is rejection.



Status



✅ Verified



It contains only:



\- execution intent

\- runtime authorization



No policy information.



No decision object.



No runtime context.



No trust record.



The ExecutionRequest is therefore the minimal object required to authorize execution outside the Runtime.

## Audit Notes

VerificationCrypto performs five responsibilities only.

- Build the canonical Trust Record.
- Compute deterministic Trust Record hashes.
- Create digital signatures.
- Verify digital signatures.
- Verify Trust Record integrity and authenticity.

It does not

- evaluate policy
- execute business operations
- persist Trust Records
- generate Verification artifacts
- generate Receipts

The canonical representation is the foundation of all
cryptographic operations, ensuring hashing and signing
remain deterministic regardless of later lifecycle
artifacts such as Verification or Receipt records.

Output

```text
Cryptographic Hash
```

Purpose

Delegate deterministic hash computation to the shared
Trust Record Hasher.

No additional processing occurs.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Security Properties

ReceiptHasher performs no cryptographic operations directly.

It relies entirely on

```text
TrustRecordHasher
```

for

- canonical serialization
- deterministic hashing
- cryptographic algorithm selection

This guarantees Receipt hashing remains consistent with the
rest of the cryptographic infrastructure.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Architectural Notes

ReceiptHasher is a thin wrapper around
`TrustRecordHasher`.

It introduces no additional

- serialization
- hashing logic
- cryptographic algorithms
- receipt-specific transformations

Its only responsibility is to expose a Receipt-specific
hashing interface while reusing the shared hashing
implementation.

Status

✅ Verified

## Audit Notes

ReceiptHasher performs one responsibility only.

- Delegate hash computation to the shared Trust Record Hasher.

It does not

- serialize artifacts
- implement hashing algorithms

## Audit Notes

AuthorizationSigner performs six responsibilities.

- Validate authorization TTL.
- Generate authorization metadata.

---

## Phase 2 — Delegate Hash Computation

Component

```text
TrustRecordHasher
```

Method

```text
hash(
    content

```

Purpose

Reuse the common deterministic hashing implementation instead of
creating a separate executable-content hashing algorithm.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Phase 3 — Return Content Hash

Output

```text
businessTransactionHash
```

Purpose

Return the canonical hash that will be embedded into the
`ExecutionAuthorizationPayload`.

This hash is later used by the execution gateway to verify that
the executable content has not changed between authorization and
execution.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Security Properties

The Executable Content Hasher performs no cryptographic
implementation itself.

It guarantees that both the authorization producer and the
execution verifier rely on the same deterministic hashing
implementation.

By embedding the resulting
`businessTransactionHash` into the authorization payload, the
system cryptographically binds an authorization to the exact
executable content it approved.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Architectural Notes

ExecutableContentHasher is a thin wrapper around
`TrustRecordHasher`.

It introduces no additional

- serialization
- hashing logic
- cryptographic algorithms

Its purpose is to provide a domain-specific abstraction for
hashing executable content while ensuring a single canonical
implementation is reused throughout the system.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Audit Notes

ExecutableContentHasher performs one responsibility only.

- Compute the canonical hash of `ExecutableContent` by delegating
  to `TrustRecordHasher`.

It does not

- implement hashing algorithms
- perform canonical serialization directly
- sign authorizations
- verify hashes
- manage cryptographic keys
- persist artifacts

The implementation deliberately avoids duplicate hashing logic,
ensuring that authorization generation and execution verification
always compute identical hashes for identical executable content.

## Architectural Notes

CryptoBootstrap is the composition root of the crypto subsystem.

It is responsible for

- loading cryptographic configuration
- registering built-in providers
- assembling configured providers
- exposing singleton provider instances
- constructing hybrid providers

It does not

- hash artifacts
- sign artifacts
- verify signatures
- manage cryptographic keys
- perform cryptographic operations directly

Those responsibilities are delegated to the constructed
`CryptoProvider` instances.

Status

## Audit Notes

CryptoBootstrap performs five responsibilities.

- Load runtime crypto configuration.
- Register built-in hash and signature providers.
- Assemble configured `CryptoProvider` instances.
- Cache provider instances for reuse.
- Construct hybrid cryptographic providers when configured.

All cryptographic operations remain delegated to the providers it
creates. CryptoBootstrap serves solely as the composition and

## Security Properties

The File Key Provider

- validates the configured key directory exists
- verifies key files exist before loading
- never generates cryptographic keys
- never performs signing or verification
- returns Node.js `KeyObject` instances

Private and public keys are loaded independently from separate PEM
files.

Status

✅ Verified

## Architectural Notes

FileKeyProvider is a development and self-hosted key management
implementation.

It is responsible only for retrieving cryptographic key material from
the filesystem.

It does not

- generate keys
- hash artifacts
- sign artifacts
- verify signatures
- manage cryptographic algorithms

The implementation explicitly notes that it can be replaced by external
key management systems such as

- KMS
- HSM
- Cloud Key Vault

without changing the higher-level cryptographic components.

Status

## Audit Notes

FileKeyProvider performs five responsibilities.

- Resolve the configured key directory.
- Determine private and public key file paths.
- Load PEM-encoded keys from the filesystem.
- Return Node.js `KeyObject` instances.
- Provide metadata describing the configured signing algorithm.

It serves as the key retrieval abstraction for the Parmana crypto
subsystem, allowing cryptographic services to remain independent of the
underlying key storage mechanism.

    primary CryptoProvider
)

SignatureVerifier(
    secondary CryptoProvider
)
```

## Phase 3 — Validate Signature Entries

Extract

```text
primarySignature

secondarySignature
```

Validation

```text
Both entries exist
```

Failure

```text
Return false
```

Purpose

Ensure both expected signature entries are present before
verification.

```

Output

```text

## Phase 5 — Verify Secondary Signature

Component

```text

```

Provider

```text
Secondary CryptoProvider
```

Input

```text
Artifact

Secondary Signature

Secondary Public Key
```

Output

```text
Boolean
```

Purpose

## Phase 6 — Return Verification Result

Operation

```text
primaryVerified &&
secondaryVerified
```

Output

```text
Boolean
```

Purpose

Return success only when both signatures verify successfully.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Security Properties

The Hybrid Verifier

- requires exactly two signatures
- validates both signature entries exist
- independently verifies each signature
- fails closed by returning `false` if bundle validation fails
- requires both verifications to succeed

It performs no cryptographic implementation directly.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Architectural Notes

HybridVerifier is an orchestration component.

It is responsible only for coordinating multi-algorithm verification.

It does not

- serialize artifacts
- hash artifacts
- implement signature algorithms
- manage cryptographic keys

All verification operations are delegated to two independent
`SignatureVerifier` instances configured with separate
`CryptoProvider` implementations.

Status

✅ Verified

---

## Audit Notes

HybridVerifier performs six responsibilities.

- Validate the signature bundle structure.
- Create verifiers for the primary and secondary crypto providers.
- Validate the presence of both signature entries.
- Verify the primary signature.
- Verify the secondary signature.
- Return a single verification result requiring both signatures to
  succeed.

The implementation follows a fail-closed approach: malformed bundles,
missing signatures, or any failed verification result in an overall
verification failure. This supports hybrid cryptographic deployments by
requiring successful verification across all configured signature
algorithms.

- Application Entry
- Authorization
- Execution
- Trust Record
- Verification

Each boundary is enforced by dedicated components that were verified
individually during the implementation audit.

# Audit Notes

The Parmana implementation enforces security through a layered model of
deterministic processing, canonical representation, cryptographic
binding, and independent verification.

The repository consistently separates:

- Business logic from cryptographic operations.
- Key management from signing operations.
- Authorization from execution.
- Execution from verification.
- Verification from receipt generation.

These invariants collectively provide the foundation for reproducible,
auditable, and cryptographically verifiable execution governance.

```

These stages are deterministic for identical inputs.

**Implementation Note**

The audited repository also includes `Dilithium3SignatureProvider`,
whose source code explicitly documents that **ML-DSA-65 signatures are
randomized**. Signing the same canonical artifact twice produces
different valid signatures. Therefore, determinism applies to the
artifact, hash, authorization content, and verification outcome—not to
the raw signature bytes produced by randomized signature algorithms.

Status

✅ Verified

---

# Audit Notes

The Parmana implementation achieves reproducibility by combining
canonical serialization, shared cryptographic infrastructure, immutable
execution evidence, and deterministic processing of business artifacts.

The audit confirms that determinism is enforced at the data,
authorization, verification, and evidence layers. Where cryptographic
algorithms intentionally introduce randomness (such as ML-DSA-65), the
repository preserves deterministic verification by operating over
canonical inputs and validating signatures against the corresponding
public keys rather than requiring identical signature values.

# Stage 45 — Architecture Summary

## Purpose

Provide a consolidated architectural assessment of the Parmana
repository based exclusively on the audited implementation.

This chapter summarizes the repository's structure, design principles,
major subsystems, and implementation characteristics without
introducing new technical details.

Status

✅ Verified

# Architectural Overview

The Parmana repository implements an execution governance platform that
controls, authorizes, verifies, and records business operations through
deterministic processing and cryptographically verifiable evidence.

Rather than combining business logic, cryptography, and auditing into a
single subsystem, the implementation separates these responsibilities
into distinct layers with clearly defined interfaces.

At a high level, the repository follows the execution lifecycle:

```text
Business Request

↓

Runtime Evaluation

↓

Policy Decision

↓

Execution Authorization

↓

Business Execution

↓

Execution Trust Record

↓

Verification

↓

Execution Receipt
```

Each stage is implemented by dedicated components that communicate
through well-defined artifacts rather than shared mutable state.

# Evidence Model

The repository consistently treats execution evidence as immutable.

Key evidence artifacts include:

```text
SignedExecutionAuthorization

↓

ExecutionTrustRecord

↓

Verification Result

↓

ExecutionReceipt
```

Each artifact is constructed, signed or verified, and then consumed by
the next stage of the execution pipeline.

This chained evidence model supports traceability across the execution
lifecycle.

# Security Characteristics

The implementation establishes security through multiple complementary
mechanisms rather than a single control.

These mechanisms include:

```text
Canonical Serialization

↓

Deterministic Hashing

↓

Digital Signatures

↓

Authorization Binding

↓

Independent Verification

↓

Receipt Generation
```

Each mechanism protects a different aspect of execution integrity,
providing defense in depth throughout the execution lifecycle.

# Implementation Assessment

Based on the audited implementation, the repository exhibits several
notable architectural characteristics:

### Strong Layering

Business logic, execution control, cryptographic operations, and audit
evidence are separated into dedicated subsystems with clear
responsibilities.

### Reusable Infrastructure

Core cryptographic services such as serialization, hashing, signing,
and verification are reused across multiple workflows instead of being
reimplemented.

### Extensibility

Provider registries and builder patterns allow additional
cryptographic algorithms or implementations to be introduced with
minimal changes to business logic.

### Auditability

Execution artifacts are transformed into verifiable evidence through
deterministic hashing, digital signatures, and independent
verification, supporting reproducible audit trails.

### Maintainability

Shared abstractions, explicit interfaces, and layered dependencies
reduce coupling between functional domains, simplifying future
maintenance and evolution.

# Overall Architectural Assessment

The audited repository implements a modular execution governance
architecture centered on deterministic processing and cryptographically
verifiable execution evidence.

Its primary architectural strengths are:

- Clear separation between business execution and cryptographic
  services.
- Consistent use of shared infrastructure for hashing, signing, and
  verification.
- Strong evidence lifecycle from authorization through receipt
  generation.
- Support for algorithm agility through provider abstractions.
- Layered trust model with independent verification.

The implementation demonstrates a coherent design in which execution
authorization, trust evidence, verification, and receipt generation
form a continuous chain of verifiable artifacts.

# Audit Conclusion

This implementation audit examined the Parmana repository component by
component, validating responsibilities, dependencies, execution flows,
and architectural relationships directly from the source code.

The audit covered:

- Runtime orchestration.
- Policy evaluation.
- Execution authorization.
- Business execution.
- Trust record construction.
- Verification.
- Receipt generation.
- Cryptographic infrastructure.
- Hybrid cryptography.
- Security invariants.
- Determinism guarantees.
- Repository architecture.

The resulting architecture is structured around a deterministic
execution pipeline in which business decisions are transformed into
cryptographically protected evidence that can be independently verified
after execution.
