# Repository Invariants — Phase 1F Canonical Reference

This document is the canonical reference for the architectural invariants established by Phases 1A–1E (passive connector SDKs, execution ownership inside `execution-gateway`, internalized implementation, a single production execution pipeline) and locked permanently in Phase 1F. It supersedes informal descriptions scattered across prior phase reports — those reports remain useful history (see `docs/architecture/execution-pipeline-report.md`), but this document is what to trust for "is X enforced, and how."

Every invariant below is backed by an automated test that fails the build on violation, not by convention or code review discipline.

## How to run these checks locally

```
npm test -- --maxWorkers=2          # runs every invariant test below (they're plain vitest files)
npx vitest run tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts             # just the repo-level checks
npx vitest run packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/public-api-boundary.test.ts   # just the package-local public-API check
```

All of the above already run automatically in CI on every push and pull request — see [CI enforcement](#ci-enforcement) below.

## Invariant 1 — Connector packages own no production execution

**Rationale:** Phase 1B/1C's whole point was reducing `connector-sdk`/`connector-hubspot` to passive SDKs (capability constants, DTOs, schemas, signal models) with zero executable behavior. A connector package that makes a real HTTP call to a vendor would silently create a second execution path outside `ExecutionGateway`'s authorization/audit chain.

**Enforcement:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`, describe block `"connector packages own no production execution"`. Scans every `.ts` file under every `packages/connector-*/src/` directory (discovered generically by listing `packages/*` and filtering for a `connector-` prefix — not a fixed package list) and asserts none contain a `fetch(` call.

**Expected failure mode:** Adding any `fetch(...)` call inside `packages/connector-sdk/src/**` or `packages/connector-hubspot/src/**` (or any future `connector-*` package) fails the corresponding `it.each` test with the exact file path in the failure message.

**Regression example:** A future PR adds a "convenience" method to `RazorpayCapabilities.ts` that calls the Razorpay API directly to pre-validate a key before returning capability constants. This test fails immediately, naming that file.

**Corresponding test:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` → `describe("connector packages own no production execution")`.

---

## Invariant 2 — Only `execution-gateway` may implement `Connector`

**Rationale:** Phase 1C moved every executable vendor adapter (`GatewayRazorpayAdapter`, `GatewayHubSpotAdapter`, `GatewayHttpAdapter`) into `execution-gateway`. A second package implementing the `Connector` interface would be a second, unaudited execution surface.

**Enforcement:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`, describe block `"adapter ownership: only execution-gateway may implement Connector"`. Scans all `packages/*/src` for `implements Connector` and checks the result against a two-entry allowlist: the four gateway-owned classes, plus the one named `MockConnector` test double in `connector-sdk`.

**Expected failure mode:** Any new `implements Connector` outside `execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/` (and not the named mock) fails both `it()` assertions in this block, listing the unapproved file.

**Regression example:** Someone adds `class StripeConnector implements Connector` directly inside a new `packages/connector-stripe/src/` package instead of routing it through `execution-gateway`. Both assertions fail, naming `packages/connector-stripe/src/StripeConnector.ts`.

**Corresponding test:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` → `describe("adapter ownership: only execution-gateway may implement Connector")`.

---

## Invariant 3 — Exactly one production execution pipeline (no direct `connector.execute()`/`adapter.execute()` outside three named sites)

**Rationale:** Phase 1E's core invariant: `RuntimeEngine → ExecutionGateway.execute() → ExecutionControlService → SecureConnector → SdkConnectorExecutor → Gateway-owned Adapter → Business System` must be the only path a business action can take. A stray direct call to a connector's `.execute()` anywhere else bypasses authorization, signal verification, replay protection, and audit generation entirely.

**Enforcement:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`, describe block `"no direct connector.execute()/adapter.execute() call outside approved gateway-owned components"`. Scans all `packages/*/src` for the call-site pattern `connector.execute(`/`adapter.execute(` (distinct from method *definitions*) and checks the result against a closed, three-entry, named allowlist:

| File | Why it's approved |
|---|---|
| `packages/execution-control/src/ExecutionControlService.ts` | Canonical dispatch stage 1 — resolves a `SecureConnector` and calls its `.execute()` |
| `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/SdkConnectorExecutor.ts` | Canonical dispatch stage 2 — calls the raw vendor `Connector` after all checks pass |
| `packages/api/src/webhooks/RazorpaySettlementProcessor.ts` | Named worker exception — read-only fetch-verify of webhook-claimed settlement state, not business-action execution (see Invariant 5) |

**Expected failure mode:** A fourth call site anywhere in `packages/*/src` fails the "every call site is on the approved list" assertion, naming the new file.

**Regression example:** A future refactor of `RazorpayRefundService`-style code adds a "fast path" that calls `this.connector.execute(...)` directly to skip the authorization ceremony for an internal retry. This fails immediately.

**Corresponding test:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` → `describe("no direct connector.execute()/adapter.execute() call outside approved gateway-owned components")`.

---

## Invariant 4 — `RuntimeEngine` and `ExecutionTrustApplication` cannot bypass `ExecutionGateway`

**Rationale:** These are the two components positioned to reach a connector directly if someone got impatient with the abstraction. Both must depend only on the injected `ExecutionSystem` interface, never on `execution-gateway`, `connector-sdk`, or `connector-hubspot` concretely.

**Enforcement:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`, describe blocks `"RuntimeEngine cannot bypass ExecutionGateway"` and `"ExecutionTrustApplication cannot bypass ExecutionGateway"`. Each asserts the named file: exists; imports none of `@parmana/execution-gateway`, `@parmana/connector-sdk`, `@parmana/connector-hubspot`; contains no `new (Gateway|Connector|Http|Razorpay|HubSpot)*(` construction; contains no `fetch(` call.

**Expected failure mode:** Adding any of those imports/constructions to either file fails the corresponding `it()`.

**Regression example:** A "quick fix" imports `GatewayRazorpayAdapter` into `RuntimeEngine.ts` to special-case a Razorpay retry inline. Fails on the import-absence assertion.

**Corresponding test:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` → the two `describe` blocks named above.

---

## Invariant 5 — API routes and bootstrap never execute business actions directly; workers only through the one named exception

**Rationale:** HTTP routes should only ever call `application.execute(...)` (the top-level `ExecutionTrustApplication` entry point); bootstrap composition should only construct objects, never call `.execute(`; and out-of-band workers (currently just the Razorpay settlement poller) may only touch a connector directly through the one documented, read-only, non-authorizing exception.

**Enforcement:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`, three describe blocks:
- `"API routes never execute adapters directly"` — scans `packages/api/src/routes/` generically for adapter imports/construction/`fetch(`.
- `"bootstrap composes but never executes business actions"` — scans `packages/api/src/bootstrap/` generically for any `.execute(` call.
- `"workers never execute adapters directly unless named as gateway-owned verification infrastructure"` — scans `packages/api/src/webhooks/` generically for `fetch(`, with `RazorpaySettlementProcessor.ts` as the one named, approved exception (also covered by Invariant 3's allowlist).

**Expected failure mode:** A new route file constructing an adapter, a bootstrap file calling `.execute(`, or a new webhook file calling `fetch()` without being added to the exception set — each fails its respective `it.each`.

**Regression example:** A new `packages/api/src/routes/admin-replay.ts` route is added that directly constructs `createGatewayRazorpayConnector()` and calls it to "replay" a refund for debugging. Fails the routes-block assertion.

**Corresponding test:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` → the three describe blocks named above.

---

## Invariant 6 — Package-level ownership: only `execution-gateway`/`api` may depend on `execution-control`/`execution-gateway`

**Rationale:** Invariants 1–5 check source *content* (import statements, call sites) inside specific, named files or directories. This invariant checks the same guarantee at the *package* level, generically, so a brand-new package — one that doesn't exist yet and therefore isn't named anywhere in this file — is covered automatically the moment it imports `@parmana/execution-control` or `@parmana/execution-gateway` from somewhere it shouldn't.

**Enforcement:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`, describe block `"package-level ownership: execution-control and execution-gateway have a closed dependent set"`. Scans every file across every package's `src/` for `from "@parmana/execution-control"` / `from "@parmana/execution-gateway"` import statements and checks the importing package against an allowlist:
- `@parmana/execution-control` may be imported by: `execution-control` itself, `execution-gateway`, `api`, and `receipt` (type-only — see note below).
- `@parmana/execution-gateway` may be imported by: `execution-gateway` itself and `api`.
- A separate, generic assertion additionally confirms no package whose name starts with `connector-` (present or future) imports either.

**Note on the `receipt` exception:** `packages/receipt/src/ExecutionReceiptBuilder.ts` and `packages/receipt/src/models/ExecutionReceipt.ts` import the `ExecutionPermit` *type* from `@parmana/execution-control` to shape the receipt data model — no executable class, no `.execute()` call, no adapter. This is benign and pre-existing, discovered while building this invariant (not introduced by Phase 1F). Separately, and out of this phase's scope: `packages/receipt/package.json` does not declare `@parmana/execution-control` as an explicit dependency despite importing from it — a minor pre-existing package.json hygiene gap, not an execution-ownership violation, left unchanged.

**On dependency-cruiser:** This repository has a `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` config with five pre-existing rules (`no-circular`, `shared-must-not-import-project`, `policy-must-not-depend-on-runtime`, `gateway-must-not-depend-on-api`, `connector-must-not-call-api`), but it is not wired into any npm script or CI step, and — discovered while investigating whether to extend it for this phase — it does not currently resolve `@parmana/*` workspace-scoped imports at all for this repo's TypeScript-project-references + `NodeNext` module resolution setup (verified directly: a known real import of `@parmana/execution-control` from `GatewayConnectorRegistry.ts` resolves to zero dependency edges in dependency-cruiser's own JSON output, as do its `@parmana/crypto` and `@parmana/connector-sdk` imports). Its five existing rules have therefore likely never caught a real cross-package violation. Wiring a silently-non-functional check into CI would create false confidence, so Phase 1F did not do that; this invariant is enforced instead by extending the text-scanning mechanism already proven to work (Invariants 1–5 use the same mechanism). Fixing dependency-cruiser's TS-project-references resolution is a legitimate follow-up but is orthogonal tooling debt, not an execution-architecture regression, and is out of Phase 1F's scope.

**Expected failure mode:** A package outside the allowlist importing either `@parmana/execution-control` or `@parmana/execution-gateway` fails the corresponding `toEqual([])` assertion, naming the file.

**Regression example:** A future `packages/connector-stripe` package imports `SessionCredentialSecureConnector` from `@parmana/execution-control` to "wire itself up directly" instead of going through `execution-gateway`. Fails both the specific allowlist check and the generic "no connector package" check.

**Corresponding test:** `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` → `describe("package-level ownership: execution-control and execution-gateway have a closed dependent set")`.

## Invariant 7 — Public API boundary: execution-gateway's implementation classes stay internal

**Rationale:** Phase 1D internalized `GatewayConnectorRegistry`, `GatewayCapabilityConnectorPolicy`, `SdkConnectorExecutor`, `CredentialVaultAdapter`, `GatewayRazorpayAdapter`, `GatewayHubSpotAdapter`, `GatewayHttpAdapter`, and `ConnectorEvidence` behind three stable factory functions (`createGatewayConnectorRegistry`, `createGatewayRazorpayConnector`, `createGatewayHubSpotConnector`). If any of these classes leak back into the public package barrel (`packages/execution-gateway/src/index.ts`), external packages regain the ability to construct raw adapters directly, silently reopening Invariant 2/3's bypass surface.

**Enforcement — two complementary layers:**
1. `packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/public-api-boundary.test.ts` (Phase 1D) — imports the package's public entry point (`src/index.ts`, resolved directly by Vitest — not the built `dist/index.js`) at runtime and asserts a named list of 10 internal symbols is absent (`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`), and that the 3 factories + `ExecutionGateway` are present.
2. `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`, describe block `"Phase 1D public API boundary stays generically enforced"` (added Phase 1F, closing a gap identified in Task 1's inventory: layer 1's list is hardcoded, so a *new* internal class added to `connector-execution/` later wouldn't be covered until someone remembered to add its name). This layer derives the "must stay internal" symbol set *from `connector-execution/index.ts` itself* (every file it re-exports, minus the three factory files) rather than from a hardcoded list, then asserts none of those symbol names appear in the public barrel's source text (comments stripped, to avoid false positives from explanatory prose).

**Expected failure mode:** Re-adding `export * from "./connector-execution/index.js"` to `packages/execution-gateway/src/index.ts` (undoing Phase 1D), or individually re-exporting any one internal class, fails both layers — layer 1 immediately for the 10 named classes, layer 2 for any of them *and* for any new implementation class added later.

**Regression example:** A future contributor adds a ninth implementation class, `GatewayStripeAdapter`, to `connector-execution/`, and — out of habit, mirroring the existing `export *` lines — adds `export { GatewayStripeAdapter } from "./connector-execution/GatewayStripeAdapter.js"` directly to the public `index.ts` instead of following the factory pattern. Layer 1 doesn't know this class exists yet and passes. Layer 2 derives its expected-internal set from `connector-execution/index.ts` at test-run time, sees `GatewayStripeAdapter` in the re-exported-files list, and fails.

**Corresponding tests:** `packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/public-api-boundary.test.ts` (layer 1) and `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` → `describe("Phase 1D public API boundary stays generically enforced (not just a hardcoded symbol list)")` (layer 2).

## CI enforcement

CI exists: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, triggered on every push to `main` and every pull request. Its steps: checkout → `npm ci` → `npm run build` → `npm run lint` → `npm run typecheck` → a retired-terminology grep guard → `npm test`.

`npm test` runs `vitest run`, whose root config (`vitest.config.ts`) includes `**/tests/**/*.test.ts` and `**/test/**/*.test.ts` repo-wide with no package scoping — so both `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` and `packages/execution-gateway/tests/unit/public-api-boundary.test.ts` are already picked up and run automatically, with no CI configuration changes required. Confirmed directly: the full `npm test` run used to validate this phase reports all of them passing as part of the same 888-test run (see Task 6 results).

No new CI step was added this phase. An attempt to add one (wiring `dependency-cruiser` into CI to strengthen Invariant 6) was made and then reverted after discovering the tool doesn't actually resolve the relevant imports in this repo (see Invariant 6's note) — shipping that would have been a CI step that always passes regardless of whether the invariant holds, which is worse than no step.

## Non-goals of this document

This document covers **execution-ownership and API-boundary** invariants only (Phases 1A–1E's subject matter). It does not re-document credential-handling semantics, authorization ordering, signal verification, replay protection, or audit generation — those are unchanged by every phase covered here and are exercised by the existing production test suites (`packages/execution-control/tests`, `packages/execution-gateway/tests`, `packages/runtime/tests`, `packages/api/tests`), not by the architecture tests referenced above.
