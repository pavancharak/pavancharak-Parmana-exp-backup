\# Parmana Trust Core



\# Milestone 2 — End-to-End Execution Pipeline



\*\*Date:\*\* June 28, 2026



\---



\# Objective



Following the successful implementation of the core Execution Trust architecture, the next milestone is to validate the complete execution pipeline from Business Transaction acceptance through Receipt generation.



This milestone shifts the focus from architecture implementation to execution correctness and deterministic behavior.



\---



\# Goal



Demonstrate that Parmana can execute an entire trust chain without architectural gaps.



The execution pipeline shall produce deterministic artifacts that can be independently replayed and verified.

Every stage must produce an immutable artifact.



\---



\# Runtime Engine



The next implementation is a Runtime Engine that orchestrates the entire execution pipeline.



Suggested location:



```text

packages/runtime/src/RuntimeEngine.ts

```



Responsibilities:



\* Accept a BusinessTransaction.

\* Coordinate all runtime components.

\* Preserve immutable artifacts.

\* Stop execution on validation failures.

\* Return the completed ExecutionTrustRecord.



The Runtime Engine owns orchestration only. Business logic remains within the specialized services.



\---



\# End-to-End Integration Test



Create a complete runtime integration test.



Suggested location:



```text

packages/runtime/tests/runtime.integration.test.ts

```



The test should execute the complete pipeline and verify:



\* BusinessTransaction accepted.

\* Decision created.

\* Execution created.

\* ExecutionTrustRecord created.

\* Verification succeeds.

\* Receipt generated.

\* Pipeline completes without exceptions.



\---



\# Replay Integration Test



Suggested location:



```text

packages/replay/tests/replay.integration.test.ts

```



Assertions:



\* Replay executes the same policy.

\* Recorded Decision equals replayed Decision.

\* Outcome matches.

\* Reason matches.

\* Replay reports a successful match.



Replay must follow the same deterministic execution path as the runtime.



\---



\# Verification Integration Test



Suggested location:



```text

packages/verification/tests/verification.integration.test.ts

```



Assertions:



\* Trust Record hash verifies successfully.

\* Verification status is VERIFIED.

\* Any modification of the Trust Record causes verification to fail.

\* Verification remains deterministic across repeated executions.



\---



\# Receipt Integration Test



Suggested location:



```text

packages/runtime/tests/receipt.integration.test.ts

```



Assertions:



\* Receipt references the correct Trust Record.

\* Receipt hash is deterministic.

\* Receipt is generated only after successful verification.

\* Receipt cannot be generated for an unverified Trust Record.



\---



\# Runtime Invariants



The following invariants must hold for every execution:



1\. BusinessTransaction is immutable.

2\. Decision is produced only by DecisionService.

3\. Execution references exactly one Decision.

4\. Every Execution belongs to exactly one BusinessTransaction.

5\. Every BusinessTransaction produces exactly one ExecutionTrustRecord.

6\. Verification operates only on immutable Trust Records.

7\. Receipt generation requires successful verification.

8\. Replay must reproduce the recorded Decision for deterministic inputs.



Violation of any invariant constitutes an execution trust failure.



\---



\# Success Criteria



This milestone is complete when:



\* All runtime integration tests pass.

\* Replay reproduces recorded decisions.

\* Verification detects tampering.

\* Receipt generation succeeds only after verification.

\* End-to-end execution is deterministic.

\* The monorepo builds without errors.

\* All execution artifacts are immutable.

\# Expected Deliverables



```

packages/runtime/src/RuntimeEngine.ts



packages/runtime/tests/runtime.integration.test.ts



packages/runtime/tests/receipt.integration.test.ts



packages/replay/tests/replay.integration.test.ts



packages/verification/tests/verification.integration.test.ts

```



\---



\# Outcome



Completion of this milestone will demonstrate that Parmana is not only architecturally complete but operationally correct.



The platform will provide a deterministic, verifiable execution pipeline that transforms organizational authority into cryptographically verifiable execution evidence, supporting replay, verification, auditing, and receipt generation through a single immutable trust chain.
