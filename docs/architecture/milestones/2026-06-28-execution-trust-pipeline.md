\# Parmana Trust Core — Architecture Milestone



\## End-to-End Execution Trust Pipeline Completed



\*\*Date:\*\* June 28, 2026



\---



\# Overview



This milestone completes the first end-to-end implementation of the Parmana Execution Trust Pipeline.



The entire monorepo now builds successfully with zero TypeScript compilation errors, and every package has been aligned to the canonical Execution Trust architecture.



\---



\# Build Status



All packages compile successfully.



```

✓ @parmana/shared

✓ @parmana/policy

✓ @parmana/runtime

✓ @parmana/replay

✓ @parmana/storage

✓ @parmana/crypto

✓ @parmana/verification

✓ @parmana/api

```



\---



\# Canonical Trust Chain



Parmana now implements the following deterministic execution flow.



```

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

BusinessTransaction

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyReference

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyRouter

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyValidator

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyAdapter

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

SignalValidator

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

PolicyEngine

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

DecisionService

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Decision

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

ExecutionService

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

ExecutionTrustRecordService

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

ExecutionTrustRecord

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

VerificationService

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

ReceiptService

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Receipt

```



This establishes a cryptographically verifiable chain from organizational authority through execution and verification.

\# Domain Model



The domain model has been separated into immutable inputs, runtime artifacts, and trust artifacts.



\## Immutable Inputs



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* BusinessTransaction

\* PolicyReference



These objects describe what an organization intended before any runtime evaluation occurs.



\---



\## Runtime Artifacts



\* Decision

\* Execution

\* Override



These objects are produced during deterministic execution.



\---



\## Trust Artifacts



\* ExecutionTrustRecord

\* Verification

\* Receipt



These provide immutable evidence of execution and verification.



\---



\# Architectural Changes



\## BusinessTransaction



BusinessTransaction now represents only the immutable input to policy evaluation.



It no longer contains a Decision.



```

Authority

Authorization

Intent

PolicyReference

Signals

```



Decision is now produced later by the runtime.



\---



\## DecisionService



Decision construction has been extracted into its own service.



Responsibilities:



\* Generate Decision

\* Assign Decision ID

\* Bind PolicyReference

\* Bind runtime signals

\* Record outcome

\* Record reason

\* Timestamp evaluation



DecisionService does not execute policies or persist data.



\---



\## ExecutionService



ExecutionService is now a pure orchestration service.



Responsibilities:



\* Accept a previously generated Decision

\* Create immutable Execution

\* Persist Execution

\* Update execution status



ExecutionService no longer evaluates policy.



\---



\## ExecutionTrustRecordService



ExecutionTrustRecordService creates the canonical aggregate for replay, verification, auditing, and receipt generation.



The aggregate now contains:



\* BusinessTransaction

\* Executions

\* Overrides

\* Verifications

\* Receipts



\---



\## RuntimeContext



RuntimeContext now accumulates immutable execution artifacts.



```

RuntimeContext

│

├── transaction

├── decision

├── execution

├── override

├── evidence

├── verification

├── receipt

└── trustRecord

```



BusinessTransaction remains immutable throughout execution.



\---



\## Replay



Replay has been aligned with the runtime architecture.



Replay no longer depends on embedded policy artifacts.



Instead it receives:



\* BusinessTransaction

\* ExecutionTrustRecord

\* Resolved Policy



Replay reconstructs execution through the same PolicyEngine used by runtime and compares the recorded Decision with the replayed Decision.



This guarantees deterministic replay.



\---



\## Storage



The storage schema has been aligned with the new domain model.



BusinessTransaction now persists:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* Metadata

\* PolicyReference

\* Signals



Decision is no longer stored as part of BusinessTransaction.



\---



\# Architectural Principles Established



The implementation now enforces the following principles:



\* BusinessTransaction is immutable.

\* Decision is produced only by DecisionService.

\* Execution records what happened after a Decision.

\* ExecutionTrustRecord is the canonical aggregate.

\* Replay follows the same deterministic execution path as runtime.

\* Verification validates the immutable trust record.

\* Receipt cryptographically attests the verified trust record.



\---



\# Current Architecture Status



\## Domain



Complete.



\## Runtime



Complete.



\## Policy Layer



Complete.



\## Replay



Complete.



\## Storage



Complete.



\## Verification



Complete.



\## Receipt Generation



Complete.



\---



\# Result



Parmana has transitioned from a collection of independent components into a cohesive Execution Trust Infrastructure.



The system now provides a deterministic, verifiable, and replayable execution pipeline in which organizational authority, policy evaluation, runtime execution, verification, and cryptographic receipt generation are connected through a single immutable trust chain.



This milestone establishes the architectural foundation for future work such as distributed execution, remote verification, governance APIs, conformance testing, and enterprise integrations without requiring changes to the core trust model.
