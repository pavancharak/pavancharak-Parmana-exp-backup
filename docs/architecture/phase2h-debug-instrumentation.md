# Phase 2H — Remove Residual Debug Instrumentation (TD-19)

Closes TD-19 (`docs/architecture/repository-certification.md`, Technical Debt Register), a Phase 2E finding. This is an implementation phase scoped to removing print-debugging statements left in the production execution path — no architectural, runtime, or observability redesign, no production behavior change.

**Fixed against:** commit `dd4fee3` (`test(runtime): certify replay endpoint semantics and close TD-13`), the tip of `main`. Working tree was clean before this phase began.

---

## 1. Original TD-19 Finding

From `docs/architecture/repository-certification.md`:

> 9 debug `console.log` statements sit in the core request/execution hot path, unconditional (no log-level or `NODE_ENV` gate), firing on every request: `"[ROUTE] before/after execute"` (2, `execute.ts`) and numbered `"[APP] 1"`–`"[APP] 7"` stage markers spanning the entire `ExecutionTrustApplication.execute()` method. Introduced 2026-07-18 (`a6b9d8b`, "Execution Integrity Platform v0.3"); never previously flagged by any prior audit (Phase 1H's certification, `GAP-AUDIT.md`, or Phase 2B's assessment). Debug instrumentation left behind after a development session; no functional or security impact, but noise in every production log line for the system's most central method. **Next touch to either file: delete all 9 (or replace with a real, level-gated logger if execution tracing is actually wanted).**

Rated **Low**, classified **Open**.

Also independently corroborated, incidentally, by `docs/architecture/phase2d-execution-failure-testing.md` (a prior phase, explicitly out of its own scope): "Two stray debug `console.log` statements were observed, incidentally, in production source during this phase's empirical verification... Neither affects correctness... Flagged here for visibility as an unrelated, minor cleanup opportunity, not addressed in this phase."

## 2. Independent Verification

Every finding below was re-derived from source, not copied from Phase 2E or Phase 2D.

**Repository-wide search**, `console\.(log|debug)\(` across the full tree (excluding `node_modules`): 125 files matched. The overwhelming majority are `examples/tutorials/**/run.ts` (deliberately narrated CLI tutorials whose entire purpose is printing output to the terminal), `scripts/*.ts`/`.mjs` (CLI tooling: key generation, migrations, secret rotation — meant to print), SDK examples (`typescript/examples/**`, `python` has none since Python doesn't use `console`), and test helper files (`*-availability.ts`, integration tests logging response bodies for manual debugging of the test itself, not the product). None of these are "production execution path" in TD-19's sense — they are CLI-adjacent, example, or test-only code, correctly out of scope.

**Narrowed to production `src/`** (`packages/*/src/**/*.ts`, `typescript/src/**/*.ts`): exactly **3 files, 10 statements** — confirmed by direct grep, not estimation:

```
packages/runtime/src/ExecutionTrustApplication.ts:68,73,78,83,88,94,102   (7)
packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts:108,115                                (2)
packages/api/src/server.ts:84                                             (1)
```

`typescript/src/` had zero matches.

This confirms TD-19's count of "9" exactly (7 + 2 — TD-19's own inventory correctly excluded `server.ts`'s line, which this phase also treats separately, see §3/§5). No debug statement was found beyond what TD-19 already identified, and none of TD-19's 9 turned out to be misclassified on closer reading.

**Introduction commits** (`git log -S`, exact string search, not `git blame` on the current line — avoids attributing a later reformat as the origin):

- `packages/runtime/src/ExecutionTrustApplication.ts`'s 7 lines and `packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts`'s 2 lines: **both introduced in the same commit**, `a6b9d8b` ("feat(platform): Execution Integrity Platform v0.3", 2026-07-18) — a large, multi-feature commit (caller auth, nonce store/replay protection, credential isolation, Supabase persistence, Dilithium3, production bootstrap/CI) whose message never mentions logging or tracing work.
- `packages/api/src/server.ts`'s 1 line: introduced separately, at the file's original creation, commit `9fe09ee` ("refactor: separate runtime library from API server", 2026-06-26) — three weeks before the other two, unrelated to the `a6b9d8b` debug-tracing pattern.

**Direct diff inspection of `a6b9d8b`** (not just the resulting file) confirms these are genuine, unambiguous print-debugging artifacts, not a stylistic logging choice:

- In `ExecutionTrustApplication.ts`, the commit's diff shows each `console.log("[APP] N - ...")` line **directly replacing** a pre-existing, meaningful section comment (`// Accept Business Transaction`, `// Execute Runtime`, `// Verification`, `// Receipt`, `// Load completed Trust Record`) at the exact same position. This is the signature of someone stepping through `execute()` to trace where a bug occurred, substituting comments for print statements, and never reverting before the commit landed.
- In `execute.ts`, the same commit's diff shows the two `console.log` lines inserted with **column-0 indentation**, breaking the surrounding block's consistent indentation — a strong, independent signal of an ad hoc, unreviewed edit rather than a deliberate code-style decision.

**`server.ts`'s line, by contrast**, was present from the file's first commit as a single, one-time "the server is listening" message (`console.log("API running on http://localhost:3000")`, later parameterized to `${HOST}:${PORT}`) — the conventional pattern for an HTTP server announcing its bound address at boot. Nothing about its origin, shape, or frequency (once per process start, not once per request) resembles the other 9.

**Whether any is intentional production observability:** the 9 `[APP]`/`[ROUTE]` lines have no log level, no structured fields, no request-correlation id, fire unconditionally on every single request through the system's most central method, and their own introducing commit message never describes them as an observability feature. `server.ts`'s line is a conventional, one-time startup diagnostic. These are treated as two structurally different things, not one class of 10.

**Whether any automated test depends on it:** repository-wide search for the literal strings `[APP]` and `[ROUTE]` found exactly 5 files: the 2 production source files themselves, `docs/architecture/repository-certification.md` and `docs/architecture/phase2d-execution-failure-testing.md` (both prose describing the finding, not asserting behavior), and `docs/guides/e2e/03-credential-enforcement.md` (see §4 below). **Zero test files reference either string.** No test spies on, parses, or asserts against `console.log` output anywhere in `packages/runtime/tests` or `packages/api/tests` for the `execute` path.

## 3. Logging Inventory

| File | Class/Method | Line(s) | API | Message | Introduced | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `packages/runtime/src/ExecutionTrustApplication.ts` | `ExecutionTrustApplication.execute()` | 68 | `console.log` | `"[APP] 1 - accept"` | `a6b9d8b` (2026-07-18) | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| same | same | 73 | `console.log` | `"[APP] 2 - runtime"` | `a6b9d8b` | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| same | same | 78 | `console.log` | `"[APP] 3 - verification"` | `a6b9d8b` | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| same | same | 83 | `console.log` | `"[APP] 4 - receipt"` | `a6b9d8b` | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| same | same | 88 | `console.log` | `"[APP] 5 - load trust record"` | `a6b9d8b` | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| same | same | 94 | `console.log` | `"[APP] 6 - found trust record"` | `a6b9d8b` | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| same | same | 102 | `console.log` | `"[APP] 7 - returning"` | `a6b9d8b` | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| `packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts` | `createExecuteRouter()` route handler | 108 | `console.log` | `"[ROUTE] before execute"` | `a6b9d8b` (2026-07-18) | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| same | same | 115 | `console.log` | `"[ROUTE] after execute"` | `a6b9d8b` | Temporary debug / Development artifact |
| `packages/api/src/server.ts` | module-level, server bootstrap | 84 | `console.log` | `` `API running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}` `` | `9fe09ee` (2026-06-26) | Production observability / Startup diagnostic |

No statement in this inventory was classified as Structured operational logging, Test-only, or Legacy — the repository has no other logging in these files to classify. No statement was found outside these two commits or these three files within production `src/`.

## 4. Sensitive Data Exposure Findings (Task 1.5)

**None found.** Every one of the 10 statements was inspected for interpolated content:

- The 7 `ExecutionTrustApplication.ts` lines and 2 `execute.ts` lines are all **static string literals** — no template literals, no interpolated variables, no reference to `transaction`, `trustRecord`, headers, credentials, or any request/response data. They print only a fixed label and a step number.
- `server.ts`'s line interpolates only `HOST` and `PORT`, both non-secret server bind configuration (and `HOST` defaults to `0.0.0.0`), never a credential, token, or user-supplied value.

No credentials, API keys, tokens, signed authorization envelopes, signature material, customer PII, or vendor request/response bodies were ever logged by any of these 10 statements, at any point in their history (confirmed by reading the full diff of both introducing commits, not just the current file state). There is no historical exposure to disclose, no log-aggregation retention concern, and no credential rotation warranted from this phase's findings. This is stated explicitly, as a distinct check, per this phase's Task 1.5 — not folded silently into the removed/retained classification.

## 5. Classification Rationale

**Temporary debug / Development artifact (9 statements, `ExecutionTrustApplication.ts` ×7, `execute.ts` ×2):**
- Introduced in the same commit, with no stated logging intent in that commit's message.
- Direct diff evidence shows they replaced meaningful section comments at the exact same code positions (`ExecutionTrustApplication.ts`) and were inserted with broken indentation (`execute.ts`) — both independent signals of an unreviewed, ad hoc edit rather than a deliberate logging feature.
- Unconditional (no `NODE_ENV`/log-level gate), firing on every request through the system's most central method — the profile of a bug trace left in, not a designed observability signal.
- No log level, no structured fields, no correlation id — nothing distinguishes them from `print` statements.
- Zero test dependency (§2).
- Not documented as supported observability in `CLAIMS.md`, `GUARANTEES.md`, `docs/architecture/**`, or any deployment/operations guide (`docs/ROADMAP-v1.md`, `docs/architecture/repository-invariants.md`, `docs/guides/e2e/19-deployment-guide.md`, `docs/guides/e2e/20-production-operations.md`, `docs/guides/e2e/21-troubleshooting.md` were all checked; none mention `[APP]` or `[ROUTE]`).

**Production observability / Startup diagnostic (1 statement, `server.ts`):**
- Fires exactly once per process start, not once per request — a fundamentally different frequency and purpose than the 9 above.
- Conventional pattern for an HTTP server (announcing its bound host/port), present since the file's creation, not introduced alongside the debug-tracing commit.
- Explicitly protected by this phase's own Preserve/Task 3 instructions ("Do NOT remove: ... startup diagnostics").
- No sensitive content (§4).

No statement required the STOP-condition path: none is consumed by production monitoring, parsed by operational tooling, required by deployment verification, referenced by a test, or documented as supported observability (the one documentation reference found, `docs/guides/e2e/03-credential-enforcement.md`, is addressed separately in §7 as it does not meet that bar — see rationale there).

## 6. Removed Statements

All 9 statements classified Temporary debug / Development artifact were removed:

- `packages/runtime/src/ExecutionTrustApplication.ts`: all 7 `console.log("[APP] N - ...")` calls deleted. The section comments they had overwritten (`// Accept Business Transaction`, `// Execute Runtime`, `// Verification`, `// Receipt`, `// Load completed Trust Record`) were restored in their place — a faithful reversal of what the introducing commit's own diff shows was removed, not a new addition. No statement, branch, ordering, or awaited call was touched; every `await this.X.Y(...)` call and its arguments are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- `packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts`: both `console.log("[ROUTE] before/after execute")` calls deleted, and the surrounding block's indentation (broken by the original ad hoc edit, see §2) restored to match the rest of the function. The `application.execute(transaction)` call and `res.json(result)` line are otherwise unchanged.

`git diff --stat` confirms only these two files changed in production source, plus this documentation file.

## 7. Retained Statements

- `packages/api/src/server.ts:84` — the startup diagnostic (`API running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`) — retained unchanged, per §5's classification and this phase's explicit Preserve instruction.
- **`docs/guides/e2e/03-credential-enforcement.md`** quotes the exact text `[ROUTE] before execute` / `[APP] 1 - accept` / `[APP] 2 - runtime` in a "Runtime Progress" section, presented as captured terminal output from a manual end-to-end test session, with the narrative "This confirms the transaction entered the Runtime Engine and progressed into the execution pipeline." This is the one documentation reference this phase's Task 2 usage audit found. It does not meet any STOP condition: it is not a claim of supported observability (no `GUARANTEES.md`/`CLAIMS.md` entry references it), not parsed by any tooling, and not asserted by any test — it is a point-in-time captured transcript in an internal walkthrough series (`docs/guides/e2e/`, a manual step-by-step session log, distinct from the published `docs/site/` documentation), the same category of artifact TD-19's own register entry recommended deleting regardless. **Not edited in this phase** — updating narrative documentation to match new log output is outside this phase's explicitly non-observability, non-documentation-redesign scope, and doing so wasn't requested. Recorded here, and again in §9, as a known, harmless side effect: that guide's captured console-output block is now stale (it will no longer literally reproduce against current code) and is a candidate for a future, separately-scoped documentation pass.

## 8. Regression Validation

**New tests:** none required. Task 5's usage audit found no test anywhere asserting on `console.log` output for `/execute` or `ExecutionTrustApplication.execute()` (confirmed by search across `packages/runtime/tests` and `packages/api/tests` for `console.log`/`console.debug`/`spyOn(console`/the literal strings `[APP]`/`[ROUTE]` — the only hits were tests' own unrelated diagnostic `console.log`/`console.dir` calls for manual triage of test failures, not assertions against product output). No test needed updating or weakening.

**Full regression run, independently re-executed against the fixed tree:**

```
npx tsc -b                        → clean, 0 errors
npm test -- --maxWorkers=2        → 140 test files passed, 15 skipped (unchanged from before this phase);
                                     961 tests passed, 39 skipped, 0 failed (identical counts to before this phase)
```

Identical pass/skip counts before and after this phase's changes is itself evidence of no behavioral change: removing print statements that only ever wrote to stdout, with no branch, ordering, return-value, or error-handling changes, could not plausibly alter any test's outcome, and the run confirms it did not.

`git status`/`git diff --stat` confirm exactly two production files changed (`packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts`, `packages/runtime/src/ExecutionTrustApplication.ts`) plus this new documentation file. No test file, schema, OpenAPI spec, SDK, or any other production source was touched.

## 9. Remaining Limitations

- **`docs/guides/e2e/03-credential-enforcement.md`'s captured "Runtime Progress" transcript is now stale** — it quotes exact debug output that no longer exists in the running system (§7). Not fixed here (documentation-narrative update is outside this phase's scope); flagged as a candidate for a future documentation pass.
- **No level-gated tracing was added in place of the removed statements.** TD-19's own recommendation offered two options ("delete all 9... or replace with a real, level-gated logger if execution tracing is actually wanted"); this phase took the deletion option, since no repository evidence was found that execution tracing at this granularity is an actual product requirement (no `GUARANTEES.md`/`CLAIMS.md` entry, no operations guide, no monitoring dashboard reference names or parses this output — see §5). If request-level execution tracing is wanted going forward, it remains an open, separately-scoped feature request, not something this phase inferred a need for.
- **`server.ts`'s single `console.log` remains unstructured** (plain string, not JSON, no log level) — unchanged from before this phase, consistent with its classification as a conventional one-time startup message and out of this phase's non-observability-redesign scope.

## Final Verification

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| TD-19 independently verified | ✓ — all 9 flagged statements confirmed present, correctly classified, and correctly attributed to their introducing commit (`a6b9d8b`); no additional debug statements found beyond TD-19's original count |
| Every debug statement checked for sensitive data exposure | ✓ — all 10 (including the retained `server.ts` line) inspected for interpolated content; none found (§4) |
| Temporary debug instrumentation removed | ✓ — all 9 `[APP]`/`[ROUTE]` statements deleted from `ExecutionTrustApplication.ts` and `execute.ts`; meaningful section comments restored where the debug lines had overwritten them |
| Production observability preserved | ✓ — `server.ts`'s startup diagnostic untouched |
| Runtime behavior unchanged | ✓ — no branch, ordering, awaited call, or return value changed; only `console.log` calls and comments touched |
| Security behavior unchanged | ✓ — no authorization, signal-verification, replay-protection, audit, or credential-handling code touched |
| Execution architecture unchanged | ✓ — no class, method signature, or call graph changed |

Supported by: repository searches (§2), source references and diff inspection of both introducing commits (§2, §3), and regression tests (§8: `tsc -b` clean; 961 tests passed, 39 correctly skipped, 0 failed — identical counts before and after).

## Final Recommendation

**TD-19 CLOSED.**

No sensitive data exposure was found (§4) — there is no separate, higher-priority item to escalate. All 9 statements independently confirmed as temporary debug instrumentation (unconditional, structurally identical to print-debugging, traced to a single development commit whose own diff shows them overwriting pre-existing meaningful comments) were removed, with the overwritten comments restored. The 1 statement independently confirmed as intentional production observability (`server.ts`'s startup diagnostic) was preserved untouched, exactly as this phase's Preserve list required. Zero tests depended on the removed output; none needed updating. Full regression suite is unchanged in every count (961 passed, 39 skipped, 0 failed, `tsc -b` clean) before and after, demonstrating removal of these statements had no effect beyond eliminating unconditional per-request console noise from the system's central execution path.
