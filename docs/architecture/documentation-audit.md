# Documentation Audit — Phase 1G

Verification report for the Phase 1G documentation set: `system-architecture.md`, `execution-walkthrough.md`, `../developer/extending-parmana.md`, plus their two Phase 1E/1F foundations (`execution-pipeline-report.md`, `repository-invariants.md`). Produced by direct comparison against source — every claim below was checked against the file it describes, not re-derived from the docs themselves.

## Scope

This is a **lightweight** audit, matching the lightweight automated check it's paired with (`tests/architecture/documentation-references.test.ts`): confirm the docs are accurate and internally consistent, not a full prose/style review. Four things were checked:

1. Every backtick-quoted file path the docs cite as evidence resolves to a real file.
2. A sample of concrete, falsifiable claims (class names, method line numbers, package dependency edges) matches source.
3. The five documents cross-reference each other correctly and don't contradict one another.
4. No production source file was modified in the course of this work.

## 1. Automated reference check

`tests/architecture/documentation-references.test.ts` scans all five documents for backtick-quoted paths matching real repo-path shapes (`packages/*/src|tests/**/*.ts(x)`, `tests/architecture/**/*.ts`, `docs/**/*.md`, `policies/`) and asserts each one exists.

**First run surfaced 6 false-positive failures**, all in paths that are intentionally hypothetical, not evidence:

| Path | Where | Why it doesn't exist |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/connector-stripe/src/StripeCapabilities.ts` | `extending-parmana.md`, "Adding a new vendor" walkthrough | Stripe is a worked example of a vendor *not yet built* — the walkthrough shows what you'd create |
| `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/GatewayStripeAdapter.ts` | same | same |
| `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/createGatewayStripeConnector.ts` | same | same |
| `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createStripeConnector.ts` | same | same |
| `packages/connector-stripe/src/StripeConnector.ts` | `repository-invariants.md`, Invariant 2 "Regression example" | Describes a file that must **never** be created — it's the counterexample the invariant test guards against |
| `packages/api/src/routes/admin-replay.ts` | `repository-invariants.md`, Invariant 5 "Regression example" | Same — a hypothetical bad route used to illustrate what the test catches |

These aren't documentation errors — creating any of these files to satisfy the test would be wrong (in two cases, it would mean adding the exact bypass the invariant exists to prevent). The test's own docstring scopes it to "evidence citations," and these six are illustrative counterfactuals, not citations. Fixed by adding a small, explicit, documented allowlist (`HYPOTHETICAL_EXAMPLE_PATHS`) to the test rather than weakening the pattern generally or fabricating files — any new hypothetical path added to a doc in the future will still fail loudly until someone deliberately allowlists it.

**After the fix: 43/43 pass.**

## 2. Manual spot-checks against source

### Method line numbers (`execution-walkthrough.md`)

All 10 `file.ts:N` citations checked against actual method declarations:

| Claim | Verified |
|---|---|
| `ExecutionTrustApplication.execute()` — `ExecutionTrustApplication.ts:64` | ✅ |
| `Runtime.execute()` — `Runtime.ts:31` | ✅ |
| `RuntimeEngine.execute()` — `RuntimeEngine.ts:125` | ✅ |
| `RuntimePipeline.execute()` — `RuntimePipeline.ts:30` | ✅ |
| `ExecutionComponent.execute()` — `ExecutionComponent.ts:44` | ✅ |
| `ExecutionGateway.execute()` — `ExecutionGateway.ts:214` | ✅ |
| `ExecutionControlService.execute()` — `ExecutionControlService.ts:44` | ✅ |
| `SessionCredentialSecureConnector.execute()` — `SessionCredentialSecureConnector.ts:70` | ✅ |
| `SdkConnectorExecutor.execute()` — `SdkConnectorExecutor.ts:41` | ✅ |
| `BusinessTrustPipeline.execute()` — `BusinessTrustPipeline.ts:31` | ✅ |

### Class/function existence (`system-architecture.md`, `execution-walkthrough.md`, `extending-parmana.md`)

Checked 17 additional named classes not covered by the line-number pass above (`PolicyRouter`, `PolicyEngine`, `SignalIntentBinder`, `ExecutionGate`, `RefusalRecordBuilder`, `VerificationService`, `ReceiptService`, `BusinessTransactionService`, `RuntimeAuthorizationSigner`, `GatewayAttestationSigner`, `RuntimeBuilder`, `RuntimeFactory`, `TrustChainValidationComponent`, `BusinessTrustRecordBuilder`, `GatewayConnectorRegistry`, `InMemorySessionCredentialVault`, `CredentialVaultAdapter`) plus the four gateway adapters and the public barrel's factory exports (`createExecutionSystem.ts`, `RazorpaySettlementProcessor.ts`). All exist exactly as named. Note `ExecutionGate` (in `runtime/src/ExecutionGate.ts`) is a distinct class from `ExecutionGateway` — both are real, docs use each correctly in context.

`packages/execution-gateway/src/index.ts` (the public barrel) was read directly: it exports only `ExecutionGateway` and the documented extension-point types, plus the three named factories — never a concrete adapter/registry/executor class. Matches Invariant 7's claim.

### Package dependency graph (`system-architecture.md` §8)

Checked every edge in the graph against each package's `package.json` `dependencies` and, where a dependency looked type-only, its `tsconfig.json` project `references`.

**Found and fixed one real inaccuracy:** the graph stated `shared, crypto → (everything else depends on these; they depend on nothing internal)`. `@parmana/crypto` in fact depends on `@parmana/shared` — declared in `package.json`, referenced in `tsconfig.json`, and imported in 18 of `crypto`'s source files (key providers, signers, hashers all use shared domain types). Corrected to:

```
shared          →  (everything else depends on this; depends on nothing internal)
crypto          →  shared
```

All other edges in the graph (`policy`, `envelope-verifier`, `execution-system`, `receipt`, `runtime`, `execution-control`, `connector-sdk`, `connector-hubspot`, `execution-gateway`, `api`) were verified correct, including `receipt`'s `execution-control (type-only)` edge — confirmed via `tsconfig.json` project reference plus the actual type-only import in `ExecutionReceiptBuilder.ts` (no runtime `package.json` dependency, matching the "type-only" label).

**Minor observation, not fixed (below the bar for this pass):** the graph omits `storage` and `replay` from its package list entirely, and `runtime`'s row omits its (harmless, Invariant-4-irrelevant) reference to `storage`. The graph reads as a summary of the packages central to the execution pipeline, not a claim of exhaustiveness, and prose elsewhere in the document doesn't assert completeness — so this wasn't treated as an error. Worth tightening in a future pass if the graph's scope is meant to be exhaustive.

## 3. Cross-document consistency

- `system-architecture.md` → `execution-pipeline-report.md`, `repository-invariants.md`, `execution-walkthrough.md`, `../developer/extending-parmana.md`: all four links resolve, and each target's own framing (Phase 1E baseline, Phase 1F canonical invariants) matches how `system-architecture.md` describes them.
- `execution-walkthrough.md` ↔ `system-architecture.md` §3: the 14-stage walkthrough and the pipeline diagram describe the same call chain in the same order; no contradictions.
- `extending-parmana.md` ↔ `repository-invariants.md`: every "must never be modified directly" row cites an invariant number that exists and matches that invariant's actual enforcement description.
- `repository-invariants.md`'s "How to run these checks locally" commands (`npm test -- --maxWorkers=2`, the two `npx vitest run` invocations) were run as part of this audit — pass.

No internal contradictions found across the five documents.

## 4. Build and test verification

```
npx tsc -b                        → clean, no errors
npm test -- --maxWorkers=2        → 135 test files passed, 16 skipped; 931 tests passed, 40 skipped, 0 failed
```

The only failures seen at any point were the 6 documentation-reference false positives in §1, fixed as described. No other test — including the Phase 1E/1F architectural invariant tests this audit depends on — regressed.

## 5. Files touched by this audit

| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/architecture/documentation-references.test.ts` | Added `HYPOTHETICAL_EXAMPLE_PATHS` allowlist | Exclude 6 intentionally-hypothetical example/counterexample paths from the evidence-citation check (§1) |
| `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` | Corrected §8 dependency graph's `crypto` edge | `crypto` depends on `shared`; the doc claimed it didn't (§2) |
| `docs/architecture/documentation-audit.md` | New (this file) | Phase 1G deliverable |

No production source file (anything under `packages/*/src`) was modified. Both changes above are documentation and test-infrastructure only.

## Conclusion

Phase 1G's documentation set is accurate and internally consistent as of this audit: every evidence citation resolves, every sampled method/line/class claim matches source exactly, and the one real drift found (the `crypto`→`shared` dependency edge) has been corrected. `tsc -b` and the full test suite are clean.
