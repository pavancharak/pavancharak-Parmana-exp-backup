# Execution Pipeline Report — Phase 1E Architectural Baseline

Status: canonical baseline as of Phase 1E. Supersedes any prior informal description of execution ownership. Produced by static repository search plus automated regression tests (`tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`), not by inspection alone — every claim below is backed by a passing or explicitly-approved-exception test.

## 1. Execution entry points

Repository-wide search for `execute(`, `dispatch(`, `perform(`, `invoke(`, `run(` method definitions, and for `new Gateway*`, `new Connector*`, `new Http*`, `new Razorpay*`, `new HubSpot*` construction sites, classified:

| Symbol / file | Classification |
|---|---|
| `ExecutionGateway.execute()` (`packages/execution-gateway/src/ExecutionGateway.ts`) | **Canonical production execution** — the sole production execution API |
| `ExecutionControlService.execute()` (`packages/execution-control/src/ExecutionControlService.ts`) | **Canonical production execution** — stage 2, resolves and dispatches to a `SecureConnector` |
| `SessionCredentialSecureConnector.execute()`, `SecureConnector.execute()` (`packages/execution-control/src`) | **Canonical production execution** — stage 3, session/credential-scoped dispatch |
| `SdkConnectorExecutor.execute()` (`packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution`) | **Canonical production execution** — stage 4, dispatches to the raw vendor `Connector` |
| `GatewayRazorpayAdapter.execute()`, `GatewayHubSpotAdapter.execute()`, `GatewayHttpAdapter.execute()` | **Canonical production execution** — stage 5, the vendor-facing HTTP call |
| `RuntimeEngine.execute()`, `Runtime.execute()`, `ExecutionTrustApplication.execute()`, `RuntimePipeline.execute()`, `BusinessTrustPipeline.execute()`, `RuntimeComponent` subclasses (`ExecutionComponent`, `ExecutionEvidenceComponent`, `ReceiptComponent`, `TrustChainValidationComponent`) | **Internal helper** — orchestration/pipeline stages that call into the canonical pipeline via an injected `ExecutionSystem`; none dispatch to a vendor directly |
| `ExecutionSystem.execute()` interface, `DefaultExecutionSystem`, `HttpExecutionSystem` (`packages/execution-system`) | **Internal helper (interface + alternate implementations)** — the seam `ExecutionGateway` implements; `DefaultExecutionSystem`/`HttpExecutionSystem` exist in the package but are not constructed anywhere in production bootstrap (see §3) |
| `createExecutionSystem()`, `createExecutionGateway()`, `createExecutionControl()`, `createConnectorRegistry()`, `createRazorpayConnector()`, `createHubSpotConnector()` (`packages/api/src/bootstrap`) | **Bootstrap** — compose the pipeline, never call `.execute(` themselves (enforced, see §6) |
| `executeRazorpayCapability()`, `executeHubSpotCapability()` (`connector-sdk`/`connector-hubspot`) | **Signal verification** — sign an authorization and call the *injected* `ExecutionSystem.execute()` (i.e. `ExecutionGateway`); used by `RazorpaySignalStateVerifier`/`HubSpotSignalStateVerifier` to re-fetch vendor state before policy evaluation. Does not dispatch to a vendor directly |
| `RazorpaySettlementProcessor`'s `this.options.connector.execute(...)` (`packages/api/src/webhooks`) | **Worker — approved gateway-owned verification infrastructure** (see §8) — a read-only fetch-verify call confirming a webhook's claimed settlement state, bypassing the authorization chain because it authorizes nothing; it re-confirms state, it doesn't execute a business action |
| `MockConnector.execute()` (`connector-sdk`), `InMemorySecureConnector`/execution-control test fixtures, `RecordingConnector`/`RecordingHttpConnector` in test/example files | **Test-only / Example-tutorial** |
| `examples/tutorials/**/run.ts`, `examples/scenarios/**/run.ts`, `examples/04-verified-execution/run.ts` | **Example/tutorial** |
| `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-runtime/*` (`DefaultSecureConnector.invoke()`, `InMemoryConnectorRegistry`, `CapabilityConnectorPolicy`, `DefaultExecutionChannel`, `MemoryExecutionAuditSink`) | **Legacy — confirmed dead in production** (see §4) |
| `ReplayExecutor.execute()` (`packages/replay`) | **Internal helper** — replay-testing tooling, not a production execution path |

## 2. Complete execution graph

Verified by direct source inspection, not inference:

```
HTTP request
  → packages/api/src/routes/{execute.ts, transactions.ts}
      → application.execute(...)                         [ExecutionTrustApplication.execute(), packages/runtime/src/ExecutionTrustApplication.ts:64]
          → Runtime.execute(...)                          [packages/runtime/src/Runtime.ts:31]
              → RuntimePipeline / BusinessTrustPipeline    [RuntimeComponent stages, incl. ExecutionComponent]
                  → ExecutionComponent.execute()           [packages/runtime/src/components/ExecutionComponent.ts:44]
                      → this.executionSystem.execute(request)   [injected ExecutionSystem — see binding below]
                          → ExecutionGateway.execute()     [packages/execution-gateway/src/ExecutionGateway.ts:214]
                              → verify() [signature, expiry, TTL, content hash, nonce]
                              → ExecutionControlService.execute()   [packages/execution-control/src/ExecutionControlService.ts:44]
                                  → registry.resolveCapability(action) → SecureConnector
                                  → SecureConnector.execute()  [SessionCredentialSecureConnector, packages/execution-control/src/SessionCredentialSecureConnector.ts:70]
                                      → SdkConnectorExecutor.execute()  [packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/SdkConnectorExecutor.ts:41]
                                          → connector.execute(request, context)   [raw vendor Connector]
                                              → GatewayRazorpayAdapter.execute() | GatewayHubSpotAdapter.execute() | GatewayHttpAdapter.execute()
                                                  → Business System (Razorpay / HubSpot / generic HTTP)
```

**ExecutionSystem binding** — the one place production decides what `ExecutionSystem` means, confirmed by direct read of `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createExecutionSystem.ts`:

```ts
export function createExecutionSystem(): ExecutionSystem {
  return createExecutionGateway();
}
```

Its own doc comment: *"This is the single architectural entry point for execution-system composition."* `createExecutionGateway()` constructs `ExecutionGateway` with the `executionControl` option (never the alternate `connector`/`ExecutionChannel` option that would reach the legacy `connector-runtime` subsystem — confirmed in `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createExecutionGateway.ts`).

The same `executionSystem` instance is threaded into `createRazorpaySignalStateVerifier(executionSystem)` / `createHubSpotSignalStateVerifier(executionSystem)` (`packages/api/src/application.ts:50-51`), so pre-execution signal verification's `executeRazorpayCapability`/`executeHubSpotCapability` calls also flow through this exact same `ExecutionGateway` instance, not a separate path.

## 3. Ownership map

| Responsibility | Owner | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Execution dispatch API | `execution-gateway` (`ExecutionGateway.execute()`) | Sole production `ExecutionSystem` binding (§2) |
| Connector registration | `execution-gateway` (`GatewayConnectorRegistry`, internal) | `createConnectorRegistry()` calls `createGatewayConnectorRegistry()`, never constructs the class directly (Phase 1D) |
| Credential-backed execution | `execution-gateway` (`CredentialVaultAdapter`, `SdkConnectorExecutor`, internal) | Zero external consumers (`tests/architecture` + Phase 1D audit) |
| Vendor adapters (Razorpay, HubSpot, generic HTTP) | `execution-gateway` (`connector-execution/Gateway*Adapter`, internal) | Every `implements Connector` in `packages/*/src` is either inside `execution-gateway` or the named `MockConnector` test double (enforced test) |
| Capability constants, DTOs, schemas, signal models | `connector-sdk`, `connector-hubspot` | Zero `fetch(` calls in either package's `src/` (enforced test) |
| Orchestration / policy / signal verification / receipts | `runtime` (`RuntimeEngine`, `ExecutionTrustApplication`, `RuntimeComponent` stages) | No import of `execution-gateway`, `connector-sdk`, or `connector-hubspot`; no adapter construction; no `fetch(` (enforced test) |
| HTTP routing | `api` (`routes/*.ts`) | Calls only `application.execute(...)`; no adapter import/construction (enforced test) |
| Composition root | `api` (`bootstrap/*.ts`) | Constructs but never calls `.execute(` (enforced test) |
| Out-of-band settlement verification | `api` (`RazorpaySettlementProcessor`, driven by `scripts/process-razorpay-settlements.ts`) | Named, approved exception (§8) |

## 4. Remaining legacy execution components

`packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-runtime/*` — `DefaultSecureConnector`, `InMemoryConnectorRegistry`, `CapabilityConnectorPolicy` (connector-runtime's own, distinct from `GatewayCapabilityConnectorPolicy`), `DefaultExecutionChannel`, `InMemoryGatewaySessionAuthority`, `MemoryExecutionAuditSink`, and their shared `types.ts`.

Confirmed dead in production: `createExecutionGateway.ts` only ever constructs `ExecutionGateway` via the `executionControl` option; the `connector`/`ExecutionChannel` option that would reach this subsystem is never exercised anywhere in `packages/api/src`. Not removed this phase — first flagged in the Phase 1C audit and repeatedly carried forward as explicitly out of scope. Recommended as optional cleanup for a future phase, not a Phase 1E blocker (it owns no production execution today, so it doesn't violate the single-pipeline invariant; it's inert weight, not a second path).

## 5. Duplicate execution analysis

**None found.** Every executable `Connector` implementation lives in `execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/`, one class per vendor, none duplicated. `connector-runtime`'s classes (§4) implement a *different, unused* interface pairing (`ExecutionChannel`/`SecureConnector.invoke()`) that is structurally distinct from the canonical pipeline and is never wired into production — it is dead weight, not a live duplicate pipeline. No consumer migration or duplicate removal was required this phase (Task 3 — no action taken because no duplicate exists to remove).

## 6. Architecture enforcement test results

`tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts` — **116/116 passing**. Scans `packages/*/src` generically (not a fixed file list) so a new package or file is covered automatically. Verified non-vacuous: a temporary probe file (`implements Connector` + direct `fetch()` inside `connector-sdk/src`, never committed) was independently caught by three separate checks, then removed.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Adapter ownership: only `execution-gateway` (+ named `MockConnector` exception) implements `Connector` | ✓ enforced |
| No direct `connector.execute()`/`adapter.execute()` call outside the 3-entry allowlist (`ExecutionControlService`, `SdkConnectorExecutor`, `RazorpaySettlementProcessor`) | ✓ enforced |
| `RuntimeEngine` imports none of `execution-gateway`/`connector-sdk`/`connector-hubspot`, constructs no adapter, calls no `fetch()` | ✓ enforced |
| `ExecutionTrustApplication` — same | ✓ enforced |
| Every file under `packages/api/src/routes/` — no adapter import/construction, no `fetch()` | ✓ enforced |
| Every file under `packages/api/src/webhooks/` — no `fetch()` except the named `RazorpaySettlementProcessor` exception | ✓ enforced |
| Every file under `packages/api/src/bootstrap/` — no `.execute(` call | ✓ enforced |
| Every connector package's `src/` — no `fetch()` call | ✓ enforced |
| `createExecutionSystem.ts` binds `ExecutionSystem` to `createExecutionGateway()` and constructs no other adapter | ✓ enforced |

Full regression suite: **865/865 tests passing**, 40 skipped, `tsc -b` clean.

## 7. Static search results

- `implements Connector` across `packages/*/src`: 5 matches, all approved (4 inside `execution-gateway`, 1 named `MockConnector` test double).
- `connector.execute(`/`adapter.execute(` call sites across `packages/*/src`: 3 matches, all approved (`ExecutionControlService`, `SdkConnectorExecutor`, `RazorpaySettlementProcessor`).
- `fetch(` calls across `connector-sdk/src` and `connector-hubspot/src`: 0.
- `.execute(` calls across `packages/api/src/bootstrap/`: 0.
- `implements Connector` across `examples/`: 1 (`examples/04-verified-execution/run.ts`'s `RecordingHttpConnector`) — classified Example/tutorial, out of scope for production enforcement (the test suite scans `packages/*/src` only, by design; examples are documentation, not shipped code).

## 8. Explicit list of approved exceptions

| Exception | File | Reason it's approved |
|---|---|---|
| `RazorpaySettlementProcessor`'s direct `connector.execute(...)` call | `packages/api/src/webhooks/RazorpaySettlementProcessor.ts` | Read-only fetch-verify against Razorpay to confirm a webhook's claimed refund status before writing a `SettlementConfirmation` — authorizes nothing, executes no business action, and is driven out-of-band by `scripts/process-razorpay-settlements.ts` (a worker, not the request path). Pre-dates Phase 1C; flagged and left unchanged in the Phase 1C credential-handling audit and again here. Codified in the architecture test's allowlist so it can't silently grow into a second business-action execution path — any *new* direct-execute call site anywhere else still fails the build |
| `MockConnector` implementing `Connector` in `connector-sdk/src` | `packages/connector-sdk/src/MockConnector.ts` | **Correction (Phase 1H certification):** this row previously claimed MockConnector is "never constructed by production bootstrap" — that was false when written and remains false. `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createVendorPaymentConnector.ts` constructs it unconditionally, and `createConnectorRegistry.ts` registers it as the live handler for the `vendor-payment` connector's `payments:execute` capability, reachable from `POST /execute` through the real `ExecutionGateway → ExecutionControlService → SecureConnector` pipeline (`server.ts:35` → `createExecutionSystem()` → `createExecutionGateway()` → `createExecutionControl()` → `createConnectorRegistry()`). This does not violate Invariant 2 — MockConnector is still the one class outside `execution-gateway` permitted to `implement Connector`, and it goes through the same full authorization/credential/audit ceremony as every other connector. But unlike Razorpay/HubSpot (which fail closed and skip registration when unconfigured), `vendor-payment` is always registered, and its `MockConnector` unconditionally returns `{ success: true }` with no real vendor call — so a `payments:execute` transaction against it receives a genuinely signed Trust Record and Receipt for an execution that never left the process. `docs/CLAIMS.md` §3 already discusses `vendor-payment` as a real, production-reachable connector used in adversarial-testing demonstrations, so this was a known repository fact — Phase 1E's specific "never constructed by production bootstrap" claim was simply wrong. See `docs/architecture/repository-certification.md` for the full finding. **Resolved (Phase 2A):** `createVendorPaymentConnector.ts` now returns `undefined` outside `NODE_ENV=test`; `createConnectorRegistry.ts` no longer registers it unconditionally. In production, `payments:execute` fails closed with the same `"No connector registered for capability"` error every other unimplemented capability already produces — MockConnector is constructed by production bootstrap only when `NODE_ENV=test`. See `docs/architecture/phase2a-production-connectors.md`. **Addendum (2026-08-05, Phase 2A.4):** the fix above was deployed to production and independently verified (Phase 2A.2), and the historical-record question — whether any prior production Trust Record/Receipt originated from a real, non-test `payments:execute` call — was resolved directly against production evidence with a finding of zero such records (Phase 2A.3). Tracked as TD-1 in `docs/architecture/repository-certification.md`, now closed; full evidence chain in `docs/operations/td1-closure-summary.md`. **Final update (2026-08-09):** `payments:execute`/vendor-payment was never on the product roadmap as a real capability; rather than building the independent signal verification that would have been required to satisfy the strategic-positioning claim "only what you authorize should become real," it was removed outright. `createVendorPaymentConnector.ts` (the file this row cites, above) no longer exists, along with its dedicated credential provider and its production-registry entry — `payments:execute` now has no connector to resolve to in any environment, not only outside `NODE_ENV=test`. `policies/vendor-payment/2.0.0/policy.json` and the shared test fixtures that use it as generic example data were deliberately retained (found to be load-bearing for 19+ unrelated tests with no execution risk, since no connector exists to pair with it); a new, differently-named, equally NODE_ENV=test-only connector (`createTestFixtureConnector.ts`, capability `test:fixture-execute`) now serves that fixture role instead. Full account: `docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-27. |
| `connector-runtime` subsystem | `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-runtime/*` | Dead code, not a live execution path (§4) — not an "exception" to the single-pipeline invariant since it owns zero production execution, but named here for completeness as the one thing that still exists without being exercised |

No other exceptions exist. No implementation class or call site required a new exception to keep the suite green.

## 9. Repository invariants established by Phase 1E

1. **Exactly one production execution pipeline** exists: `RuntimeEngine → ExecutionGateway.execute() → ExecutionControlService → SecureConnector → SdkConnectorExecutor → Gateway-owned Adapter → Business System`. Enforced by `tests/architecture/execution-boundary.test.ts`, which fails the build if a second path appears.
2. **Only `execution-gateway` may implement `Connector`** (excepting the one named `MockConnector` test double). Enforced generically across `packages/*/src` — a new package adding an adapter fails the build automatically, without needing this test file updated first.
3. **Only three call sites may invoke `connector.execute()`/`adapter.execute()` directly**, all named and justified. A fourth call site anywhere in `packages/*/src` fails the build.
4. **`RuntimeEngine` and `ExecutionTrustApplication` are structurally incapable of bypassing `ExecutionGateway`** — verified by absence of any import of `execution-gateway`/`connector-sdk`/`connector-hubspot` and absence of direct adapter construction or `fetch()`.
5. **API routes and bootstrap composition never execute business actions** — routes only ever call `application.execute(...)`; bootstrap only constructs.
6. **Connector packages own zero production execution** — zero `fetch()` calls in `connector-sdk`/`connector-hubspot` source, enforced per-package so a *new* connector package is covered without modification.
7. **The dependency graph remains acyclic** — no new dependency edges were introduced this phase (Phase 1E added no new imports between packages; the enforcement tests read source text directly rather than adding package dependencies).
8. **No production behavior, authorization ordering, signal verification, replay protection, audit generation, or credential handling changed this phase** — Phase 1E added test files and this report only; zero production `src/` files outside the new `tests/architecture/` directory were modified.

## Final verification

✓ Exactly one production execution pipeline exists (§2, §6).
✓ Every production execution reaches `ExecutionGateway.execute()` (§2).
✓ No production execution bypasses authorization, signal verification, replay protection, audit generation, or credential handling — none of these subsystems' files were touched; the pipeline reaching them is unchanged (§2, §9.8).
✓ Connector packages no longer own production execution (§3, §6, §7).
✓ Runtime behavior is unchanged — zero production `src/` diffs this phase.
✓ Security behavior is unchanged — same reason.
✓ Dependency graph remains acyclic — no new imports introduced.
