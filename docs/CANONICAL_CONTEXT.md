This is exactly what I would do. Instead of relying on conversation memory, create a \*\*Canonical Context Prompt\*\* that you can paste at the start of any future conversation. It becomes the single source of truth for Parmana's current state.



Below is the prompt I recommend.



\---



\# PARMANA CANONICAL CONTEXT (v1.0)



\## Instructions for ChatGPT



Treat this prompt as the authoritative context for all future discussions about Parmana.



Do not infer, rename, simplify, or redesign concepts unless I explicitly request it.



If any recommendation conflicts with this document, ask before changing the architecture.



Assume this document supersedes previous discussions.



\---



\# Product



Product Name



\*\*Parmana\*\*



Tagline



\*\*Proof of Human Authority in AI Systems.\*\*



Primary Product Promise



> \*\*Parmana ensures AI executes only policy-compliant actions.\*\*



Execution Invariant



> \*\*Only Parmana-approved actions are executed.\*\*



This promise applies to AI actions executed through the Parmana Runtime.



Do not claim Parmana guarantees policy compliance for AI systems that bypass Parmana.



\---



\# Problem Statement



Organizations cannot confidently deploy autonomous AI in high-impact workflows because they cannot ensure AI executes only authorized and policy-compliant actions.



\---



\# Solution



Parmana is an \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\* for AI systems.



It authorizes execution before actions occur and produces cryptographically verifiable execution evidence.



Parmana does \*\*not\*\* execute business logic.



It authorizes execution.



\---



\# Architectural Philosophy



Parmana is \*\*not\*\*:



\* an AI model

\* an AI orchestration framework

\* an agent framework

\* a workflow engine

\* a business rules engine



Parmana is an execution authorization infrastructure.



Its responsibility begins before execution and ends with independently verifiable execution evidence.



\---



\# Core Trust Chain



The canonical trust chain is:



```text

Authority

↓

Authorization

↓

Intent

↓

PolicyReference

↓

BusinessTransaction

↓

Decision

↓

Execution

↓

ExecutionEvidence

↓

Receipt

↓

ExecutionTrustRecord

↓

Verification

```



Every artifact is immutable.



\---



\# Runtime Architecture



Runtime performs:



1\. Load Policy

2\. Evaluate Policy

3\. Produce PolicyDecision

4\. Build Decision

5\. Enforce ExecutionGate

6\. Build Execution

7\. Execute Runtime Pipeline

8\. Produce Execution Trust Record



\---



\# Policy Architecture



PolicyEngine



Responsibilities:



\* evaluate exactly one policy

\* deterministic evaluation

\* return PolicyDecision



PolicyEngine never:



\* authorizes execution

\* creates Decisions

\* executes actions

\* creates trust records



\---



\# Decision Architecture



DecisionBuilder converts



PolicyDecision



↓



Decision



Decision is an immutable runtime artifact.



\---



\# Execution Architecture



ExecutionBuilder converts



Decision



↓



Execution



Execution cannot exist without a Decision.



\---



\# Execution Authorization



ExecutionGate is the canonical execution enforcement mechanism.



Execution is permitted only when



DecisionOutcome == APPROVED



All other outcomes prevent execution.



\---



\# Policy Model



PolicyRule uses



PolicyAction



Canonical PolicyAction



APPROVE



REJECT



REQUIRE\_OVERRIDE



PolicyEngine returns



PolicyDecision



using



PolicyOutcome



Canonical PolicyOutcome



APPROVE



REJECT



REQUIRE\_OVERRIDE



PolicyAction represents authored policy.



PolicyOutcome represents evaluated runtime outcome.



They must remain separate.



\---



\# Runtime Responsibilities



RuntimeEngine is an orchestrator.



It does not create Decisions directly.



It delegates to:



DecisionBuilder



ExecutionGate



ExecutionBuilder



ExecutionTrustPipeline



\---



\# SDK Philosophy



SDKs expose Parmana as a product.



SDKs do NOT expose internal architecture.



SDKs never expose:



RuntimeEngine



PolicyEngine



ExecutionGate



DecisionBuilder



ExecutionBuilder



RuntimePipeline



ExecutionTrustPipeline



PolicyRouter



\---



\# Canonical SDK Client



Exactly one public client.



ParmanaClient



All operations begin from ParmanaClient.



\---



\# Canonical SDK Operations



execute()



verify()



replay()



validatePolicy()



health()



These are the initial v1 capabilities.



\---



\# Canonical Domain Model



Authority



Authorization



Intent



PolicyReference



BusinessTransaction



Decision



Execution



ExecutionEvidence



Receipt



ExecutionTrustRecord



Verification



ReplayResult



Override



SDKs must expose these concepts consistently.



\---



\# SDK Design Principles



One SDK



One Client



Stable Domain Model



Thin Client



Language Parity



Product-Oriented API



Deterministic Behavior



Strong Typing



\---



\# Documentation Philosophy



Documentation is specification-first.



README is the executive overview.



Everything else expands the specification.



No document may redefine canonical terminology.



\---



\# Repository Layout



Current repository



```text

packages/

typescript/

python/

docs/

examples/

```



SDKs remain inside the existing repository.



Do not split repositories.



\---



\# Current Development Status



Core packages are compiling successfully.



Major runtime refactor is complete.



Policy architecture is stabilized.



Runtime architecture is stabilized.



SDKs are being rebuilt against the new architecture.



Documentation has not yet been rewritten.



\---



\# Guidance for Future Responses



When discussing Parmana:



\* Prefer precision over marketing.

\* Avoid introducing new concepts unless requested.

\* Preserve canonical terminology.

\* Preserve architectural separation of responsibilities.

\* Recommend changes only if they improve correctness or maintainability.

\* Do not drift from the current architecture without explicit approval.



\---



This prompt should be treated as the authoritative context for all future Parmana discussions until explicitly superseded by a newer canonical context document.
