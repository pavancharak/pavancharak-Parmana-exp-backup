\# Parmana Trust Model



Version: 1.0



Status: Normative



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the Parmana Execution Trust Model.



The Trust Model explains how Parmana establishes, preserves, and verifies trust throughout the execution lifecycle.



Rather than treating execution as an isolated runtime event, Parmana models execution as the final stage of a chain of explicitly linked trust artifacts.



\---



\# The Trust Problem



Modern automated systems often answer questions such as:



\* What decision was made?

\* What action was executed?



However, these answers are often insufficient.



Organizations also need to know:



\* Who had authority?

\* Who authorized the action?

\* What business intent was approved?

\* Which policy governed the execution?

\* What actually executed?

\* Can the result be independently verified?



Without explicit trust relationships, these questions become difficult or impossible to answer.



Parmana addresses this problem through an explicit execution trust chain.



\---



\# Canonical Trust Chain



Every execution is modeled using the following trust chain.



```text id="w2zywk"

Authority

&#x20;   ↓

Authorization

&#x20;   ↓

Intent

&#x20;   ↓

Business Transaction

&#x20;   ↓

Policy Reference

&#x20;   ↓

Policy

&#x20;   ↓

Decision

&#x20;   ↓

Execution

&#x20;   ↓

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;   ↓

Receipt

&#x20;   ↓

Verification

&#x20;   ↓

Replay

```



Every artifact is explicitly linked to its predecessor.



Trust flows in one direction—from business authority to verifiable execution evidence.



\---



\# Trust Artifacts



\## Authority



Represents the entity empowered to authorize execution.



Examples:



\* User

\* Role

\* Organization

\* Service



Authority establishes who possesses decision-making authority.



\---



\## Authorization



Represents explicit approval granted by an Authority.



Authorization records:



\* who approved

\* what purpose was approved

\* when approval occurred

\* optional expiration



Authorization establishes permission.



\---



\## Intent



Represents the intended business action.



Intent defines:



\* action

\* target

\* business parameters



Intent answers:



> "What is supposed to happen?"



\---



\## Business Transaction



The Business Transaction combines:



\* metadata

\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* Policy Reference

\* runtime signals



It is the canonical input accepted by the Parmana runtime.



\---



\## Policy Reference



The Policy Reference identifies the exact business policy that governs execution.



It includes:



\* policy identifier

\* policy version

\* schema version



Policy References are explicit.



Policy selection is never implicit.



\---



\## Policy



Policies define business decision logic.



Policies evaluate runtime signals and produce a business decision.



Policies do not execute business actions.



\---



\## Decision



A Decision records the outcome of policy evaluation.



Examples include:



\* Approved

\* Rejected



A Decision links policy evaluation to execution.



\---



\## Execution



Execution represents the runtime realization of an approved Decision.



Execution occurs only after trust validation and policy evaluation.



\---



\## Execution Trust Record



The Execution Trust Record preserves immutable execution evidence.



It links together the complete execution context required for verification.



\---



\## Receipt



A Receipt provides cryptographic evidence that an Execution Trust Record was produced.



Receipts support independent validation.



\---



\## Verification



Verification confirms the integrity and authenticity of execution evidence.



Verification does not modify execution artifacts.



\---



\## Replay



Replay re-evaluates historical execution for verification, investigation, and analysis.



Replay preserves historical evidence while enabling comparison.



\---



\# Trust Relationships



The Trust Model requires explicit relationships.



```text id="0j7mhi"

Authority

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Authorization.authorityId



Authorization

&#x20;       │

Intent.authorizationId

&#x20;       ▼

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Receipt

```



Broken trust relationships invalidate execution trust.



\---



\# Trust Principles



\## Explicit Authority



Every execution originates from an identifiable Authority.



\---



\## Explicit Authorization



Execution requires explicit authorization.



Implicit authorization is not part of the trust model.



\---



\## Explicit Intent



Business intent is captured before execution.



Intent is not inferred from runtime behavior.



\---



\## Explicit Policy



Every Business Transaction references exactly one policy.



Policy discovery is outside the trust model.



\---



\## Deterministic Decision



Policy evaluation produces a Decision based on the referenced policy and runtime signals.



\---



\## Verifiable Execution



Execution produces immutable evidence suitable for verification.



\---



\## Independent Verification



Verification does not depend on trusting the original runtime.



Evidence should be sufficient to validate execution integrity.



\---



\# Trust Boundaries



Parmana establishes trust within the execution lifecycle.



The following are outside the scope of the Trust Model:



\* user authentication

\* identity proofing

\* business policy authoring

\* external workflow orchestration

\* organizational approval processes



These systems provide inputs to Parmana but are not governed by Parmana itself.



\---



\# Threats Addressed



The Trust Model is intended to reduce risks such as:



\* orphan execution

\* unauthorized execution

\* policy substitution

\* undocumented execution

\* unverifiable execution

\* incomplete execution evidence



Mitigation depends on both the implementation and the deployment environment.



\---



\# Relationship to the Architecture



The Trust Model defines \*\*what trust relationships must exist\*\*.



The Architecture defines \*\*how those relationships are implemented\*\*.



The Specification defines \*\*what behavior conforming implementations must provide\*\*.



The Guarantees define \*\*what properties the implementation is expected to uphold\*\*.



The Proofs document \*\*the evidence supporting those guarantees\*\*.



\---



\# Guiding Principle



Execution trust is established through explicit relationships, preserved through immutable evidence, and demonstrated through independent verification.



Organizations should not be required to trust that automated systems executed correctly.



They should be able to verify it.
