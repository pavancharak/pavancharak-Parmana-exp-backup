\# Purpose



This document audits the cryptographic foundation of the Parmana Execution Trust Platform.



The Cryptography layer provides deterministic integrity, digital signatures, and independent verification for every Execution Trust Record and Receipt.



Its objective is to ensure that execution evidence cannot be modified without detection.



\---



\# Objectives



The cryptography subsystem provides:



\- Deterministic hashing

\- Canonical serialization

\- Digital signatures

\- Signature verification

\- Receipt signing

\- Replay integrity

\- Algorithm abstraction

\# Cryptographic Components



Current implementation includes:



\- CanonicalSerializer

\- TrustRecordHasher

\- ReceiptHasher

\- ArtifactSigner

\- SignatureVerifier

\- VerificationCrypto

\- ReceiptCrypto

\- CryptoBootstrap



Each component owns a single responsibility.



\---



\# Canonical Serialization



All cryptographic operations begin with canonical serialization.



Purpose:



\- deterministic byte representation

\- platform-independent hashing

\- reproducible signatures



Without canonical serialization, identical objects could produce different hashes.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Hashing



Current algorithm:



```

SHA-256

```



Hashing is used for:



\- Execution Trust Records

\- Receipts



Properties:



\- deterministic

\- collision resistant

\- platform independent



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Digital Signatures



Current algorithm:



```

Ed25519

```



Used for:



\- Trust Record signatures

\- Receipt signatures



Properties:



\- modern elliptic curve signatures

\- fast verification

\- deterministic signing

\- compact signatures



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Signature Verification



Verification validates:



\- canonical serialization

\- hash integrity

\- digital signature



Verification succeeds only if the stored artifact has not been modified.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Receipt Cryptography



Receipt generation performs:



```

Trust Record



↓



Receipt Hash



↓



Digital Signature



↓



Receipt

```



Receipts become immutable cryptographic evidence.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Replay Verification



Replay validates:



\- Trust Record reconstruction

\- SHA-256 hash

\- Ed25519 signature



Replay proves that stored evidence has remained unchanged since execution.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Key Management



Current implementation uses filesystem-based keys.



Supported operations:



\- load private key

\- load public key

\- sign

\- verify



Development keys are stored outside the Runtime and loaded through the key provider abstraction.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Crypto Bootstrap



The cryptography subsystem is initialized through a central bootstrap component.



Responsibilities include:



\- provider registration

\- algorithm selection

\- configuration loading

\- dependency construction



Current providers:



\- SHA-256

\- Ed25519



The design supports future algorithm replacement without modifying application code.



\---



\# Provider Architecture



Current provider model:



```

HashProvider



↓



SignatureProvider



↓



CryptoProvider



↓



Application

```



Algorithms are selected through provider registries rather than hard-coded references.



This enables future cryptographic migration.



\---



\# Determinism



Every cryptographic operation is deterministic.



Given the same input:



\- canonical serialization is identical

\- hash is identical

\- signature verification produces identical results



Determinism is essential for replay and independent verification.



\---



\# Security Properties



Current implementation provides:



\- integrity

\- authenticity

\- tamper detection

\- replay verification

\- immutable evidence



The implementation does not currently provide:



\- encryption

\- confidentiality

\- key rotation

\- access control



These capabilities belong to separate security layers.



\---



\# Supported Algorithms



Current



| Function | Algorithm |

|----------|-----------|

| Hash | SHA-256 |

| Signature | Ed25519 |



Future support planned:



\- Dilithium

\- Cloud KMS

\- Hardware Security Modules

\- Multiple signing algorithms

\- Algorithm negotiation



\---



\# Testing



Cryptographic functionality is validated through integration tests covering:



\- Trust Record hashing

\- Signature generation

\- Signature verification

\- Receipt generation

\- Receipt signature verification

\- Replay verification



All core cryptographic workflows are operational.



\---



\# Strengths



\- Deterministic hashing

\- Canonical serialization

\- Modern digital signatures

\- Algorithm abstraction

\- Independent verification

\- Clean provider architecture

\- Infrastructure independence



\---



\# Future Enhancements



Planned improvements include:



\- Key rotation

\- Multi-key support

\- Cloud KMS integration

\- HSM integration

\- Post-Quantum Cryptography

\- Certificate management

\- Timestamp authority integration



These enhancements extend the subsystem without changing application interfaces.

\# Conclusion
