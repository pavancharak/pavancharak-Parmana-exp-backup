\# API Audit



\*\*Version:\*\* v1 Foundation  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-07-03



\---



\# Purpose



This document audits the REST API of the Parmana Execution Trust Platform.



The API exposes the complete Execution Trust lifecycle through a small, deterministic, resource-oriented interface.



The API is intentionally thin. It performs request validation, delegates execution to the Runtime, and returns immutable execution evidence.



\---



\# Design Goals



The API is designed to provide:



\- Simple resource-oriented endpoints

\- Deterministic behavior

\- Stateless requests

\- Clear separation from business logic

\- Consistent JSON interfaces

\- Enterprise extensibility



\---



\# API Architecture



```

Client



↓



REST API



↓



Request Validation



↓



Application Layer



↓



Runtime



↓



Repository



↓



Storage

```



The API contains no execution logic.



Its responsibilities are limited to:



\- routing

\- validation

\- mapping

\- response serialization

\- error propagation



\---



\# Current Endpoints



The platform currently exposes four lifecycle endpoints.



| Endpoint | Purpose |

|----------|---------|

| POST /execute | Execute a Business Transaction |

| POST /verify | Verify an Execution Trust Record |

| POST /receipt | Generate a signed Receipt |

| POST /replay | Deterministically replay a transaction |



These endpoints implement the complete Execution Trust workflow.



\---



\# Execute Endpoint



```

POST /execute

```



\## Responsibility



Accepts a Business Transaction and initiates execution.



\### Input



Business Transaction



Contains:



\- Authority

\- Authorization

\- Intent

\- Signals

\- Policy

\- Metadata



\### Output



Execution result including:



\- Business Transaction ID

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Execution metadata



\---



\# Verify Endpoint



```

POST /verify

```



\## Responsibility



Verifies an existing Execution Trust Record.



\### Input



```

{

&#x20;   "businessTransactionId": "<uuid>"

}

```



\### Processing



The Runtime:



\- reconstructs the Trust Record

\- verifies hash integrity

\- verifies digital signature

\- persists Verification evidence



\### Output



Verification result.



\---



\# Receipt Endpoint



```

POST /receipt

```



\## Responsibility



Generates a signed Receipt after successful verification.



\### Input



```

{

&#x20;   "businessTransactionId": "<uuid>"

}

```



\### Processing



\- loads Trust Record

\- validates latest Verification

\- computes Receipt Hash

\- signs Receipt

\- stores Receipt



\### Output



Signed Receipt.



\---



\# Replay Endpoint



```

POST /replay

```



\## Responsibility



Deterministically reconstructs and verifies an existing Business Transaction.



\### Processing



Replay performs:



\- Trust Record reconstruction

\- Hash verification

\- Signature verification



Replay does not re-execute business logic.



\### Output



Replay result including verification status.



\---



\# Request Validation



The API validates incoming requests before invoking application services.



Current validation includes:



\- UUID validation

\- Required request fields

\- JSON structure validation



Invalid requests return HTTP 400.



\---



\# Response Format



Responses are returned as JSON.



Example:



```json

{

&#x20; "businessTransactionId": "...",

&#x20; "trustRecordHash": "...",

&#x20; "verified": true

}

```



Response models are deterministic and consistent across requests.



\---



\# Error Handling



Errors are propagated from the Runtime through the API.



Current error categories include:



\- Validation errors

\- Missing Trust Records

\- Verification failures

\- Receipt generation failures

\- Repository errors



Errors are returned using standard HTTP status codes.



\---



\# Stateless Design



The API is stateless.



Each request contains all information required to complete the operation.



No server-side session state is maintained.



\---



\# Separation of Concerns



The API layer does not perform:



\- business decisions

\- cryptographic operations

\- persistence

\- replay logic

\- verification logic



These responsibilities belong to lower architectural layers.



\---



\# Security



Current API security includes:



\- Request validation

\- Deterministic processing

\- Cryptographic verification



Planned enhancements:



\- Authentication

\- Authorization

\- API keys

\- OAuth

\- Rate limiting

\- Request signing

\- Audit logging



\---



\# Testing



The REST API is validated through end-to-end integration tests covering:



\- Execute

\- Verify

\- Receipt

\- Replay



Each endpoint has been exercised against the complete Runtime and Storage stack.



\---



\# Strengths



\- Small API surface

\- Clear lifecycle

\- Stateless design

\- Thin controller layer

\- Deterministic responses

\- Strong Runtime separation

\- Fully integration tested



\---



\# Future API Extensions



Planned endpoints include:



```

GET /trust-records/{id}



GET /receipts/{id}



GET /verifications/{id}



GET /executions/{id}



GET /health



GET /metrics

```



Future capabilities may also include:



\- Bulk operations

\- Search

\- Pagination

\- Filtering

\- Streaming

\- Webhooks

\- SDK generation

\# Assessment



| Area | Status |

|-------|--------|

| Execute API | Complete |

| Verify API | Complete |

| Receipt API | Complete |

| Replay API | Complete |

| Validation | Complete |

| Error Handling | Complete |

| Stateless Design | Complete |

| Integration Testing | Complete |

| Enterprise Security | Planned |



\---



\# Conclusion



The Parmana REST API successfully exposes the complete Execution Trust lifecycle through a minimal, deterministic interface.



Its thin architecture, clear separation of concerns, and end-to-end integration with the Runtime provide a stable foundation for future enterprise capabilities while maintaining simplicity and maintainability.
