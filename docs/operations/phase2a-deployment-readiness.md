# Phase 2A.1 — Operational Readiness Review Before Production Redeploy

An operational review, not a continuation of implementation. Phase 2A (commit `6eff8ec`) is implemented, tested, and documented in the repository; this review asks whether *deploying* it is safe, using evidence gathered independently of the implementation work itself. No implementation code was modified during this review. Two temporary, read-only diagnostic scripts were created under `scripts/_tmp-audit-query*.mjs` to query a database (§10) and deleted immediately after use; `git status` at the end of this review shows no changes.

**Reviewed against:** commit `6eff8ec` (`fix(production): remove MockConnector from production bootstrap (Phase 2A)`), the tip of `main`. Working tree was clean before this review began (verified: `git status`, `git diff --stat`, `git log --oneline -5`).

---

## 1. Historical MockConnector Rationale (Task 1)

**Repository evidence.** `git show ddf4bc5 -- packages/api/src/bootstrap/createVendorPaymentConnector.ts` shows the file's *original*, first-commit content (2026-07-09), already carrying this exact docstring:

> "This is the production bootstrap for the vendor-payment connector. The current implementation uses MockConnector until the real enterprise connector is introduced."

This is unambiguous, contemporaneous, first-commit evidence: **MockConnector was intentionally used as a temporary placeholder, self-documented as such from the moment it was written — not accidental, not undocumented technical debt that crept in silently.**

Corroborating repository evidence for *why* it was placed in production specifically (as opposed to only in tests): `docs/site/roadmap.mdx` (§"Move 2: Credential brokering") documents that `vendor-payment` was wired into the default server on commit `651497a` (2026-07-11) specifically to demonstrate the credential-isolation/brokering architecture claim — "This is real, tested, and running in the default server for the one connector currently registered (`vendor-payment`)." The roadmap frames `vendor-payment` as a **demonstration vehicle for an architectural claim (credential isolation)**, not as a committed real payment-processing feature. No roadmap entry, commit, or design document found commits to building a real vendor-payment integration on any timeline — unlike Razorpay and HubSpot, which have dedicated integration guides (`docs/site/integrations/{razorpay,hubspot}.mdx`) documenting real, credential-backed integrations.

**Conclusion:** intentional, temporary, self-documented technical debt, used as an architecture demonstration vehicle. Not accidental.

## 2. Production Usage Analysis (Task 2)

**Code path, traced directly in source (repository evidence):**

```
POST /execute (packages/api/src/routes/execute.ts)          ─┐
POST /transactions (packages/api/src/routes/transactions.ts) ─┴─→ application.execute(transaction)
  → ExecutionTrustApplication.execute() → Runtime.execute() → RuntimeEngine.execute()
    → RuntimePipeline → ExecutionComponent → (injected) ExecutionSystem.execute()
      → ExecutionGateway.execute() → ExecutionControlService.execute()
        → registry.resolveCapability("payments:execute")   ← the fail-closed point, Phase 2A
          → SessionCredentialSecureConnector → SdkConnectorExecutor → MockConnector.execute()
```

Both HTTP routes require caller authentication (enforced on every route except health checks — confirmed by `README.md`/`docs/CLAIMS.md` and unchanged by Phase 2A). No unauthenticated path reaches this capability.

**No scheduled job, cron, or worker invokes `payments:execute`.** Searched `scripts/` and `packages/api/src/webhooks/`: the only out-of-band worker is `RazorpaySettlementProcessor.ts` (Razorpay-specific, confirmed in Phase 1H certification), which never touches `vendor-payment`. `scripts/process-razorpay-settlements.ts` is likewise Razorpay-only.

**A second, dead routing mechanism exists and was traced to rule it out as a second production path:** `createConnectorRoute.ts` (`packages/api/src/bootstrap/`) builds a `switch (action) { case "payments:execute": return "vendor-payment"; }` mapping, constructed in `createExecutionGateway.ts` and passed as `executionControl.route`. Read `ExecutionGateway.ts` directly (lines 230–260): `this.executionControl.route(...)` is only consulted inside the `this.executionControl.channel.release(...)` branch, reached only when `this.executionControl.service === undefined`. Production always sets `executionControl.service` (`createExecutionGateway.ts:51-52`), so production always takes the `service.execute(...)` branch — `createConnectorRoute()`'s mapping is constructed at every boot but never consulted. Confirmed: the fail-closed point Phase 2A fixed (`GatewayConnectorRegistry.resolveCapability`) is the **only** live capability-resolution mechanism.

**Callers:** any holder of a valid API key in `PARMANA_API_KEYS` (confirmed present as a Fly secret on the production app, §10) submitting a `BusinessTransaction` with `intent.action: "payments:execute"`.

**Expected frequency / business importance — repository evidence only, see §4 for why production evidence could not fully corroborate this:** `docs/site` never markets `vendor-payment` as a real integration; every reference to it is qualified ("a MockConnector," "the current implementation... until the real enterprise connector is introduced," "reference mocks, not integrations"). No customer-facing documentation, pricing page, or integration guide references it as a usable payment capability. This is architecturally and documentarily consistent with "demo/reference capability, not a marketed production feature," but is not, by itself, proof that zero real calls were ever made against it — see §4.

## 3. Fail-Closed Review (Task 3)

**Question: does any production workflow currently depend on `payments:execute` succeeding?**

**Repository evidence, not speculation:**
- Full test suite (`npm test -- --maxWorkers=2`) passes cleanly against the Phase 2A commit — 941 tests passed, 40 skipped, 0 failed (confirmed independently in this review, §9). If any *test* depended on `payments:execute` unconditionally succeeding outside `NODE_ENV=test`, it would have failed; none did.
- No scheduled job or worker depends on it (§2).
- No other package's production code imports or calls anything vendor-payment-specific (`grep -rln "payments:execute|vendor-payment" packages/*/src` outside `packages/api/src` returns nothing).
- §4's Historical Data Integrity Assessment found zero evidence, across every `payments:execute` record in the one database this review could examine, of a caller identity other than this repository's own test suites.

**Answer: no evidence found of any production workflow depending on `payments:execute` succeeding.** This conclusion rests on repository evidence (no code dependent on it) plus the database evidence in §4, which is strong but explicitly not 100%-certain proof about the live production environment specifically — see §4's classification and §13.

## 4. Capability Readiness (Task 4)

**Does a real production connector exist? No.** Searched `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/` (where every real vendor adapter lives, per the architecture Phase 1A–1H established and Phase 2A did not change): contains `GatewayRazorpayAdapter.ts`, `GatewayHubSpotAdapter.ts`, `GatewayHttpAdapter.ts` — no `GatewayVendorPaymentAdapter.ts` or equivalent. No real implementation exists anywhere in the repository.

**Missing implementation:** a `GatewayVendorPaymentAdapter` (or similarly named class) implementing `connector-sdk`'s `Connector` interface, following the pattern `docs/developer/extending-parmana.md` documents under "Adding a new vendor." **Repository location it would go:** `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/`. **Planned future phase:** none found in-repo. `docs/site/roadmap.mdx` discusses `vendor-payment` only as the demonstration vehicle for the credential-brokering claim (itself flagged `[PARTIAL]`), not as a capability with a committed implementation timeline.

**Confirmed: removing MockConnector does not silently disable an intended, functioning production capability** — there was never a functioning real capability behind it. Phase 2A's fail-closed behavior surfaces the true, pre-existing state (`payments:execute` has no real backing) rather than concealing it behind a scripted success.

## 4.5 Historical Data Integrity Assessment (Task 4.5)

**Evidence sources attempted, in order of strength:**

1. **Production Trust Record / Receipt store — attempted, with a material caveat.** This session had access to Fly.io (`flyctl`, authenticated) and found `flyctl secrets list -a parmana-api` confirms the production app has `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `PARMANA_STORAGE` configured as deployed secrets — i.e., production almost certainly persists to a real Postgres/Supabase-backed store, not in-memory. **Fly does not expose secret values** (`flyctl secrets list` shows names and digests only), so this session could not directly obtain or confirm the production `DATABASE_URL`.
2. **A Supabase database this session *could* directly query** — credentials present in the local `.env` file (`DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`), explicitly documented by that file's own comment as backing "Live integration tests... Live tests create persistent rows" (i.e., a real, non-mocked Postgres database this repository's own test suite writes to when `ALLOW_LIVE_SUPABASE=1`). This session connected to it read-only (no writes, no schema changes) and queried it directly.
3. **Fly deployment logs** — `flyctl logs -a parmana-api` was checked (Phase 2A's live exposure assessment); it showed live traffic (Razorpay settlement polling) but the log window available did not extend back to cover the full 2026-07-09–2026-08-03 period, and does not itself distinguish real vs. test `payments:execute` calls.
4. **SSH into the running container** — attempted, failed on a network/tunnel limitation (documented in Phase 2A's report), not retried here.

**What the queried database showed (direct query results, not inference):**

| Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Total `payments:execute` records in `business_transactions` | 18, spanning 2026-07-11 through 2026-08-03 |
| Records with `authority.principalId = "ordering-test"` | 15 (transaction IDs prefixed `test-txn-` / `test-txn-race-`) |
| Records with `authority.principalId` / `metadata.createdBy = "integration-test"` | 3 (dated 2026-08-03 13:27–13:34 UTC — before that day's `v39` deploy at 14:14 UTC; `authority.displayName: "Integration Test"`, `authorization.purpose: "Integration Test"`) |
| Records attributable to any other identity | **0** |
| For comparison: `createdBy = "parmana-live-demo-client-server"` records in the same database | 18, but **none** with `action = "payments:execute"` — all are Razorpay actions |
| Trust Records for the 5 non-test-ID `EXECUTED` transactions | 5 found; 10 Receipts found (2 each) |
| Trust Records for the 3 `integration-test` `APPROVED` transactions | 3 found; **0 Receipts** (consistent with `ExecutionTrustApplication` only reaching `ReceiptService.generate()` after a successfully completed execution — these three show no `execution` sub-object in their Trust Record JSON at all, consistent with a test that exercises the policy/authorization stage without driving a full pipeline run) |

**Every single `payments:execute` record found, without exception, carries an explicit, self-declared test identity.** This is real, direct, evidence-based finding — not an inference from implementation behavior.

**What this evidence does not establish:** this session could not confirm that the database queried is the *same* database the production Fly app's `DATABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_URL` secrets point to. The `.env` file's own documentation frames this database's sanctioned purpose as "live integration tests," a different documented role than "production." No independent mechanism (secret-value comparison, a production audit-log cross-reference, a production-side query) was available to bridge that gap.

**Classification: C. Unable to Certify.**

- **Evidence available:** direct, positive evidence from one real, persistent database, evidence-based and specific, showing 100% test-attributed origin for every `payments:execute` record found in it; corroborating repository evidence (§1, §2, §3) that no code path depends on this capability and no marketing/documentation ever presented it as production-ready.
- **Evidence missing:** confirmation that the queried database is the production database; direct production database access; production access/request logs covering the full exposure window (2026-07-09 introduction through 2026-08-03, the last pre-fix deploy); Fly-side request logs old enough to cover that window.
- **Additional access that would resolve this:** a way to compare the production Fly app's `DATABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_URL` secret values against the `.env` credentials used here (e.g., a `fly ssh console` session with a working tunnel, or a deliberate one-time confirmation from whoever manages the Supabase project that `db.REDACTED-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co` is or isn't the production instance).
- **Operational uncertainty:** if the queried database *is* the production database, this review's finding is effectively "Confirmed Clean" in substance (zero non-test records found). If it is a *separate* database, the production database's contents remain genuinely unexamined, and this classification of "Unable to Certify" stands on its literal terms. This review does not know which is true and states that directly rather than assuming either.

## 5. Deployment Risks (Task 5)

| Risk | Severity | Description | Affected capability | Operational consequence | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unknown real caller depends on `payments:execute` silently succeeding | **Medium** | §4.5's residual uncertainty (database identity unconfirmed) means this cannot be fully ruled out | `payments:execute` / `vendor-payment` | A real caller's request would start failing with `"No connector registered for capability 'payments:execute'"` instead of a fabricated success | Rollback plan (§6/Task 6) is fast and low-risk (Fly image redeploy, no data migration); monitor logs immediately post-deploy for `vendor_payment_connector_unavailable` warnings and any `payments:execute` 4xx/5xx spike |
| `docs/site` now describes fail-closed behavior that production hasn't shipped yet | **Low** | Phase 2A updated public docs to describe the fixed behavior before the fix is deployed | Documentation accuracy only | A reader could be briefly misled about current production behavior between commit and deploy | Self-resolving on deploy; short window, no user-facing safety impact (the docs describe a *safer* state than what's currently live, not a more dangerous one) |
| Local/demo environments not setting `NODE_ENV=test` now fail closed where they previously silently succeeded | **Low** | Matches every other bootstrap factory's existing convention exactly (Phase 2A didn't introduce a new pattern) | Local dev / ad hoc demo runs of `payments:execute` specifically | A developer relying on implicit MockConnector behavior without `NODE_ENV=test` would now see a clear, named failure instead of silent success | Already documented in Phase 2A's report and updated `docs/site` pages; failure is explicit and immediately diagnosable, not a silent behavior change |
| Fly deploy itself (mechanical) | **Low** | Standard `fly deploy` of a codebase that passes `tsc -b`, full test suite, lint, typecheck | Whole app, not just this capability | Standard deploy risk (brief connection draining during machine replacement, per `fly.toml`'s `min_machines_running: 1` / 2-machine topology) | Existing Fly rolling-deploy behavior, unchanged by this fix; 2 machines already running, `auto_start_machines: true` |
| Historical Data Integrity classification is "Unable to Certify," not "Confirmed Clean" | **Medium** (procedural, not technical) | Per this review's own success criterion, this alone changes the required recommendation from READY TO DEPLOY to READY WITH CONDITIONS or NOT READY | N/A — governs the recommendation, not the code | See §9 for the recommendation and conditions | Conditions specified in §9 |

No risk found rises to **High** — no evidence of active exploitation, no evidence of a real dependent workflow, and the fix's mechanism (fail closed, matching pre-existing patterns) is itself low-risk and already fully tested.

## 6. Operational Impact

- **In production, immediately after deploy:** any `payments:execute` request will fail with a named `500`-class error (`"No connector registered for capability 'payments:execute'."`) instead of a `200` with a fabricated Trust Record/Receipt. This is the entire intended effect of Phase 2A.
- **All other capabilities (Razorpay, HubSpot, every other route) are unaffected** — Phase 2A's diff touches exactly two files, both scoped to `vendor-payment` registration only (confirmed in Phase 2A's own report and re-verified here: `git diff --stat -- packages/*/src/` shows exactly `createConnectorRegistry.ts` and `createVendorPaymentConnector.ts`).
- **No data migration, schema change, or backfill is required or performed.** This is a behavior-only change in what gets registered at boot.

## 7. Rollback Plan (Task 6 — prepared, not executed)

**Rollback trigger:** any of —
- A real caller reports a `payments:execute` failure they weren't expecting (i.e., evidence emerges that §3/§4's "no dependent workflow" conclusion was wrong).
- Elevated error rates or `vendor_payment_connector_unavailable` log volume inconsistent with expected (near-zero) traffic.
- Any unrelated regression surfaces post-deploy that correlates with this release.

**Symptoms to watch for:** `payments:execute` requests returning errors where a caller expects success; the new `console.warn({ event: "vendor_payment_connector_unavailable", ... })` log line appearing at a rate inconsistent with "expected to be silent" (§3).

**Rollback procedure:**
1. Identify the current (post-Phase-2A-deploy) release version: `flyctl releases -a parmana-api`.
2. Redeploy the last known-good pre-Phase-2A image, confirmed by this review to be **`registry.fly.io/parmana-api:deployment-01KZ3ZJEXK4RFV440R84E4E2S9`** (release `v39`, deployed 2026-08-03 14:14 UTC — the image currently live at the time of this review): `flyctl deploy -a parmana-api --image registry.fly.io/parmana-api:deployment-01KZ3ZJEXK4RFV440R84E4E2S9`.
3. No database rollback is needed — Phase 2A made no schema change and no data migration; rolling back the application image is sufficient.

**Verification after rollback:**
- `flyctl status -a parmana-api` — both machines `started`, health checks passing.
- `curl https://parmana-api.fly.dev/health` — `{"status":"UP"}`.
- Confirm `payments:execute` again resolves to `vendor-payment` (MockConnector) as before Phase 2A, via a caller-authenticated request or the existing `create-connector-registry.test.ts` suite run against the rolled-back commit.

**Expected recovery time:** a Fly image redeploy of an already-built image (no rebuild needed) typically completes in the low single-digit minutes; this app's `min_machines_running: 1` and 2-machine topology mean the service should remain available throughout the rollback (rolling replacement), not experience a hard outage.

## 8. Deployment Checklist (Task 7)

- [ ] **Production backup** — confirm the Supabase/Postgres backing store has automatic backups enabled (Supabase managed backups) before deploying; Phase 2A itself requires no data backup (no migration), but standard practice for any production deploy.
- [ ] **Deployment approval** — explicit user/operator sign-off to redeploy `parmana-api`, obtained before running `fly deploy` (this assistant will not deploy without it, per its own operating guidelines and Phase 2A's own report).
- [ ] **Rollout steps** — `git push` the Phase 2A commit(s) if not already pushed; `fly deploy` from the reviewed commit (`6eff8ec` or later, including this review's non-code documentation, if committed).
- [ ] **Health verification** — `flyctl status -a parmana-api` shows both machines `started` with passing checks; `curl https://parmana-api.fly.dev/health` returns `{"status":"UP"}`.
- [ ] **Connector registration verification** — check post-deploy logs for the new `vendor_payment_connector_unavailable` warning at startup (expected, confirms the fix is live) and confirm Razorpay/HubSpot registration logs (or absence of their unavailable-warnings, if credentials are configured) are unchanged from pre-deploy behavior.
- [ ] **`payments:execute` verification** — submit one authenticated `POST /execute` (or `/transactions`) request with `intent.action: "payments:execute"` against the live app and confirm it now fails closed with `"No connector registered for capability 'payments:execute'"` rather than succeeding.
- [ ] **Logs verification** — `flyctl logs -a parmana-api` monitored for at least one deploy cycle after rollout for any unexpected error-rate change, especially anything correlating with `payments:execute` or `vendor-payment`.
- [ ] **Rollback decision point** — if any checklist item above fails, or if real-caller impact is reported within the first monitoring window, execute §7's rollback procedure immediately rather than attempting a forward fix under live pressure.

## 9. Deployment Recommendation

**READY WITH CONDITIONS.**

Per this review's own success criterion, the Historical Data Integrity Assessment result (§4.5: **C. Unable to Certify**) precludes a bare READY TO DEPLOY recommendation, regardless of how strong the supporting evidence is. It does not, on the evidence gathered, warrant NOT READY either:

**Why READY WITH CONDITIONS, not NOT READY:**
- Every piece of repository, code-path, and database evidence gathered (§1–§4.5) points the same direction: this was intentional, self-documented, temporary demo-only technical debt; no code path depends on it succeeding; no real connector was ever displaced by fixing it; and every historical record of its use found in a real, persistent database is explicitly test-attributed.
- The residual uncertainty is narrow and specific: whether the one database this review could query is the *same* database production uses. It is not a broad, unresolved question about the fix's correctness or safety — the fix itself is fully tested and behaves identically to the already-proven Razorpay/HubSpot fail-closed pattern.
- The operational risk of the fix behaving *differently than intended* is separately and independently near-zero (§9's supporting evidence is code-level, not just database-level).

**Required conditions before or immediately upon deploy:**
1. Complete the deployment checklist in §8 in full, in order, including the rollback decision point.
2. Treat the first monitoring window post-deploy as the resolution mechanism for the §4.5 uncertainty: if `payments:execute` traffic appears at any real volume post-deploy (via the new warning log or error-rate monitoring) where §3 concluded none was expected, that is new evidence this review did not have, and should trigger the rollback procedure (§7) pending investigation, not a forward fix.
3. If practical, resolve the database-identity question directly (compare `DATABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_URL` values, or ask whoever manages the Supabase project) before or shortly after deploy, to convert this review's "Unable to Certify" into either a documented "Confirmed Clean" (closing this condition) or a "Confirmed Exposure" follow-up (if the databases differ and the production one shows different history).

## 10. Repository Evidence

- `git log --follow`, `git show ddf4bc5` — origin and original intent of `createVendorPaymentConnector.ts`.
- `docs/CLAIMS.md` §3, `docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md` G-24 — documents a "live" adversarial PoC against `vendor-payment/2.0.0`, explicitly run against "an isolated disposable clone (no production system, no real credentials, no live traffic)" and "again against this repository directly after the fix... via a freshly built, isolated clone" — corroborating, not contradicting, this review's finding that documented use of this capability has been test/demo-scoped.
- `docs/site/roadmap.mdx` — `vendor-payment`'s role as a credential-brokering demonstration vehicle, no committed real-implementation timeline.
- `packages/execution-gateway/src/connector-execution/` directory listing — confirms no real adapter exists.
- `packages/api/src/bootstrap/{createConnectorRoute,createExecutionGateway}.ts`, `packages/execution-gateway/src/ExecutionGateway.ts` lines 230–260 — confirms the dead second routing mechanism is never live.
- `packages/storage/schemas/*.sql` — table schemas used to construct the read-only diagnostic queries in §4.5.
- Full test suite run against `6eff8ec` (this review, §9 below) — 941 passed, 40 skipped, 0 failed.

## 11. Deployment Evidence

- `flyctl auth whoami` — authenticated access confirmed (`charak1987@gmail.com`).
- `flyctl status -a parmana-api` — 2 machines `started`, checks passing, current image `deployment-01KZ3ZJEXK4RFV440R84E4E2S9` (release `v39`).
- `flyctl releases -a parmana-api` / `flyctl releases --image -a parmana-api` — full release history and image references, used to identify the exact rollback target (§7).
- `flyctl secrets list -a parmana-api` — confirms `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `PARMANA_STORAGE`, `VENDOR_PAYMENT_TOKEN`, `PARMANA_API_KEYS`, and the Razorpay secrets are all configured in production (names/digests only — values not retrievable via this tool).
- `flyctl logs -a parmana-api` — confirms live traffic (Razorpay settlement polling) at review time; did not extend back far enough to cover the full historical exposure window.
- `flyctl ssh console` — attempted, failed (network/tunnel limitation, not a permissions denial), not retried.

## 12. Production Evidence

- A direct, read-only query against a real, persistent Postgres/Supabase database whose connection credentials were found in the local `.env` file, documented there as backing "live integration tests." Full findings in §4.5. **This review could not independently confirm this database is the production database** — it is reported here as the strongest evidence obtained, with that caveat stated explicitly rather than assumed away.
- No other production-side evidence (production request logs for the full historical window, production-side query access confirmed as *the* production instance, APM/telemetry) was available to this review.

## 13. Remaining Uncertainties

- **Database identity** (§4.5, §9): whether the queried Supabase database is the same one backing the deployed `parmana-api` Fly app. This is the single uncertainty driving the READY WITH CONDITIONS (rather than READY TO DEPLOY) recommendation.
- **Historical window coverage**: even if the queried database is confirmed as production, this review's queries cover whatever rows currently exist in that database as of this review's execution — not a guarantee that no row was ever created and later deleted, though nothing in the repository's data model suggests any deletion path exists for `business_transactions`/`execution_trust_records`/`receipts` (all `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign keys, no delete routes found in `packages/api/src/routes/`).
- **Fly SSH access**: unavailable in this session's network environment; would have allowed direct filesystem/env inspection of the running production container, closing the database-identity question directly.
- **Real-world caller behavior between this review and an actual deploy**: this review reflects a point-in-time snapshot; if a real caller begins using `payments:execute` between this review and the eventual deploy, §3's conclusion would need re-verification — the checklist's monitoring step (§8) exists specifically to catch this.
