\# Replay



\*\*Document:\*\* `docs/02-architecture/REPLAY.md`



\## Purpose



This document defines the \*\*Replay Engine\*\*, the Parmana architectural component responsible for independently reproducing and verifying historical authorization decisions.



Replay demonstrates that an Authorization Decision can be reproduced using the original authorization evidence preserved in the Execution Trust Record (ETR). It provides a deterministic mechanism for validation, compliance, forensic analysis, regression testing, and audit.



Replay is one of the fundamental trust guarantees provided by Parmana.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Overview



One of the defining characteristics of Parmana is that authorization decisions are \*\*reproducible\*\*.



Rather than asking users to trust a historical authorization decision, Parmana enables the decision to be replayed using the original evidence.



Replay answers the question:



> \*\*"If the same authorization request were evaluated again using the same evidence and policy, would Parmana reach the same Authorization Decision?"\*\*



\---



\# Core Principle



Replay does \*\*not\*\* create a new authorization.



Replay verifies a previous authorization.



The historical Authorization Decision remains unchanged.



Replay simply determines whether that decision is reproducible.



\---



\# Objectives



Replay provides:



\* Independent verification

\* Authorization reproducibility

\* Compliance validation

\* Forensic investigation

\* Regression testing

\* Long-term trust



Replay never changes historical authorization records.

Replay Result

```



Replay is independent of the original Runtime execution.



\---



\# Replay Inputs



Replay requires the following information.



\## Execution Trust Record



The canonical authorization record.



Provides:



\* Execution Request

\* Authorization Decision

\* Policy Reference

\* Policy Version

\* Evaluated Signals

\* Verification Metadata



\---



\## Policy Definition



Replay evaluates the same policy version recorded in the Execution Trust Record.



Policy substitution is not permitted.



\---



\## Recorded Signals



Replay uses the evidence recorded during the original authorization.



Examples include:



\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals



Replay does not collect new evidence.



\---



\## Verification Engine



Replay invokes the same Authority Verification process used during the original authorization.



Replay and Runtime share the same verification logic.



\---



\# Replay Process



The Replay Engine performs the following sequence.



```text

Load Execution Trust Record

&#x20;           │

&#x20;           ▼

Verify Record Integrity

&#x20;           │

&#x20;           ▼

&#x20;           │

&#x20;           ▼

Compare Decisions

&#x20;           │

&#x20;           ▼

Produce Replay Result

```



Every step is deterministic.



\---



\# Integrity Verification



Replay begins by validating the integrity of the Execution Trust Record.



Verification includes:



\* Hash validation

\* Digital signature verification

\* Record completeness

\* Reference validation



Replay terminates if integrity verification fails.



\---



\# Context Restoration



Replay reconstructs the original authorization context.



This includes:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Reference

\* Policy Version

\* Execution Context

\* Recorded Signals



No new runtime information is introduced.



\---



\# Policy Restoration



Replay evaluates the exact policy version referenced by the original Authorization Decision.



Historical authorization is never evaluated using newer policies.



This preserves reproducibility.



\---



\# Signal Restoration



Replay restores the recorded authorization evidence.



Signals are not recollected from enterprise systems.



Replay evaluates the evidence exactly as it existed during authorization.



\---



\# Verification



Replay invokes the Verification Engine using the restored context.



The Verification Engine produces a new Authorization Decision based on the historical evidence.



\---



\# Decision Comparison



Replay compares:



\* Original Authorization Decision

\* Replay Authorization Decision



Conceptually:



```text

Original Decision

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ├────────────┐

&#x20;       │            │

&#x20;       ▼            ▼

Replay Decision   Compare

&#x20;       │            │

&#x20;       └──────┬─────┘

&#x20;              ▼

&#x20;       Replay Result

```



\---



\# Replay Result



Replay produces one of the following outcomes.



\## Match



The replayed Authorization Decision matches the original Authorization Decision.



Replay succeeds.



\---



\## Mismatch



Replay produces a different Authorization Decision.



The discrepancy must be investigated.



\---



\## Replay Failed



Replay could not be completed.



Examples include:



\* Missing policy

\* Corrupted records

\* Invalid signatures

\* Incomplete evidence



\---



\# Determinism



Replay depends upon deterministic authorization.



Given identical:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Definition

\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Execution Context



Replay must produce the same Authorization Decision.



Determinism is a core architectural guarantee.



\---



\# Replay Metadata



Replay operations may produce metadata including:



\* Replay timestamp

\* Runtime version

\* Verification version

\* Replay outcome

\* Replay duration



Replay metadata does not modify the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Relationship to Cryptography



Replay relies on the Cryptography Layer to verify:



\* Record integrity

\* Receipt integrity

\* Digital signatures

\* Hash consistency



Replay cannot proceed if integrity verification fails.



\---



\# Relationship to Repository



Replay retrieves authorization artifacts exclusively through the Repository.



The Replay Engine never communicates directly with storage technologies.



This preserves architectural independence.



\---



\# Relationship to Audit



Replay provides auditors with independent confirmation that:



\* the historical Authorization Decision is reproducible,

\* authorization evidence remains intact,

\* organizational policy was correctly applied.



Replay strengthens audit confidence without requiring trust in the original Runtime instance.



\---



\# Failure Conditions



Replay fails when:



\* Execution Trust Record cannot be retrieved,

\* integrity verification fails,

\* required policy version is unavailable,

\* authorization evidence is incomplete,

\* replay cannot reconstruct the original authorization context.



Replay failure does not modify historical authorization records.



\---



\# Security Considerations



Replay protects against:



\* tampered authorization records,

\* modified receipts,

\* substituted policies,

\* unauthorized evidence changes,

\* incomplete replay context.



Replay always verifies integrity before authorization.



\---



\# Design Principles



The Replay Engine follows these principles:



\* Deterministic replay.

\* Immutable historical evidence.

\* Independent verification.

\* Policy version preservation.

\* Technology independence.

\* Cryptographic integrity.

\* Non-destructive operation.



\---



\# What Replay Is Not



Replay is \*\*not\*\*:



\* a new authorization,

\* a workflow execution,

\* a policy evaluation engine,

\* a storage system,

\* an audit log.



Replay reproduces an existing Authorization Decision.



\---



\# Guarantees



The Replay Engine guarantees:



\* Historical Authorization Decisions remain reproducible.

\* Replay uses the original Policy Version.

\* Replay evaluates the original authorization evidence.

\* Replay never modifies historical records.

\* Integrity verification precedes replay.

\* Replay results are independently verifiable.

\* Replay supports compliance, audit, and forensic analysis.

\# Current Reference Implementation



The current Parmana reference implementation performs replay by:



1\. Retrieving the Execution Trust Record from the Repository.

2\. Verifying SHA-256 hashes and Ed25519 signatures.

3\. Restoring the original authorization context.

4\. Loading the recorded policy version.

5\. Re-executing Authority Verification.

6\. Comparing the replayed Authorization Decision with the original decision.

7\. Producing a Replay Result.



This implementation demonstrates the deterministic nature of Parmana's authorization model and provides independent verification of historical authorization decisions.



\---



\# Summary



The Replay Engine is the mechanism that transforms Parmana from an authorization system into a verifiable trust infrastructure.



By reproducing historical Authorization Decisions using the original policy, evidence, and execution context, Replay enables organizations to demonstrate that authorization decisions remain deterministic, explainable, and independently verifiable over time.



Combined with immutable Execution Trust Records and cryptographic integrity protection, Replay provides one of Parmana's strongest guarantees:



\*\*Every authorization decision can be independently reproduced and verified long after execution has occurred.\*\*
