\# Policy Engine



\*\*Document:\*\* `docs/02-architecture/POLICY\_ENGINE.md`



\## Purpose



This document defines the \*\*Policy Engine\*\*, the Parmana Runtime component responsible for resolving, validating, and evaluating organizational policies during Authority Verification.



The Policy Engine determines \*\*which organizational rules apply\*\* to an Execution Request and evaluates whether the request satisfies those rules.



The Policy Engine does \*\*not\*\* make the final Authorization Decision independently. It evaluates policy and returns the policy evaluation result to the Verification Engine, which produces the final Authorization Decision.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Overview



Every Execution Request submitted to Parmana references a governing policy through a \*\*Policy Reference\*\*.



The Policy Engine is responsible for:



\* Resolving the referenced policy.

\* Loading the correct policy version.

\* Evaluating policy rules.

\* Determining whether policy requirements are satisfied.

\* Producing a deterministic policy evaluation result.



The Policy Engine is the implementation of organizational governance within the Runtime.



\---



\# Responsibilities



The Policy Engine is responsible for:



\* Resolving Policy References.

\* Loading Policy Definitions.

\* Validating policy integrity.

\* Evaluating authorization rules.

\* Evaluating constraints.

\* Evaluating approval requirements.

\* Producing policy evaluation results.



The Policy Engine does \*\*not\*\*:



\* Execute business operations.

\* Generate Human Approvals.

\* Persist Execution Trust Records.

\* Produce Execution Receipts.

\* Execute workflow logic.

The Policy Engine evaluates organizational policy and returns structured evaluation results.



\---



\# Core Principle



The Policy Engine answers one question:



> \*\*"Does this Execution Request satisfy the referenced organizational policy?"\*\*



It does \*\*not\*\* answer:



> \*\*"Should execution occur?"\*\*



The final Authorization Decision belongs to the Verification Engine.



\---



\# Inputs



The Policy Engine evaluates:



\## Execution Request



Provides:



\* Business Transaction

\* Requested Action

\* Requesting Principal

\* Execution Context

\* Policy Reference



\---



\## Policy Reference



Identifies:



\* Policy identifier

\* Policy version



The Runtime never infers policy.



\---



\## Policy Definition



The Policy Definition contains organizational rules.



Typical contents include:



\* Authorization requirements

\* Approval rules

\* Constraints

\* Risk thresholds

\* Required evidence

\* Business conditions



\---



\## Signals



Signals referenced by the policy may include:



\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals



Signal collection occurs outside the Policy Engine.



The Policy Engine evaluates the signals it receives.



\---



\# Policy Resolution



Policy resolution converts a Policy Reference into a Policy Definition.



```text id="hmqlmn"

Policy Reference

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Repository Lookup

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Policy Definition

```



Resolution is deterministic.



The Runtime must always evaluate the explicitly referenced policy.



\---



\# Policy Validation



Before evaluation begins, the Policy Engine validates the Policy Definition.



Validation includes:



\* Policy exists.

\* Version exists.

\* Structure is valid.

\* Required metadata is present.

\* Integrity verification succeeds.



Invalid policies cannot be evaluated.



\---



\# Policy Evaluation



The Policy Engine evaluates the Execution Request against the Policy Definition.



Typical evaluation includes:



\* Required Human Approvals.

\* Delegated authority.

\* Organizational constraints.

\* Business rules.

\* Required Enterprise Facts.

\* Required AI-Derived Signals.

\* Compliance conditions.



Evaluation is deterministic.



\---



\# Policy Evaluation Result



The output of the Policy Engine is a \*\*Policy Evaluation Result\*\*.



Conceptually:



```text id="7d5mws"

Policy Evaluation Result

├── Policy Reference

├── Policy Version

├── Evaluation Status

├── Satisfied Requirements

├── Unsatisfied Requirements

├── Validation Messages

└── Evaluation Metadata

```



The Policy Evaluation Result is \*\*not\*\* an Authorization Decision.



It becomes an input to Authority Verification.



\---



\# Rule Evaluation



Policies may define multiple rule categories.



Examples include:



\## Authorization Rules



Determine whether execution may be considered.



\---



\## Approval Rules



Specify required Human Authority.



\---



\## Constraint Rules



Define operational limits.



Examples:



\* Spending limits

\* Geographic restrictions

\* Time restrictions



\---



\## Evidence Rules



Specify required Enterprise Facts and AI-Derived Signals.



\---



\## Compliance Rules



Represent regulatory or organizational obligations.



\---



\# Policy Versioning



Policies evolve over time.



Every evaluation references a specific policy version.



Versioning enables:



\* Replay

\* Historical audit

\* Independent verification

\* Deterministic authorization



Historical Authorization Decisions remain associated with the policy version evaluated at the time of authorization.



\---



\# Determinism



The Policy Engine is deterministic.



Given the same:



\* Policy Definition

\* Execution Request

\* Signals



the Policy Evaluation Result must be identical.



Policy evaluation never depends upon:



\* processing order,

\* runtime timing,

\* infrastructure,

\* storage implementation.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification Engine



The Verification Engine consumes the Policy Evaluation Result.



```text id="ynbppv"

Policy Engine

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Policy Evaluation Result

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Verification Engine

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Authorization Decision

```



The Verification Engine combines policy evaluation with overall authority verification to produce the final Authorization Decision.



\---



\# Relationship to Repository



The Policy Engine retrieves Policy Definitions through the Repository abstraction.



The Policy Engine never depends directly on database implementations.



Repository implementations may vary while preserving behavior.



\---



\# Failure Conditions



Policy evaluation fails when:



\* Policy Reference is invalid.

\* Policy cannot be resolved.

\* Policy integrity verification fails.

\* Required policy metadata is missing.

\* Policy structure is invalid.

\* Evaluation cannot be completed.



Failure prevents Authority Verification from completing.



\---



\# Security Considerations



The Policy Engine protects against:



\* Policy substitution.

\* Policy tampering.

\* Invalid policy versions.

\* Unauthorized policy modification.

\* Ambiguous policy resolution.



Only validated Policy Definitions are evaluated.



\---



\# Design Principles



The Policy Engine follows these principles:



\* Explicit policy selection.

\* Deterministic evaluation.

\* Version-aware evaluation.

\* Repository independence.

\* Technology independence.

\* Immutable policy definitions.

\* Separation from authorization decisions.



\---



\# What the Policy Engine Is Not



The Policy Engine is \*\*not\*\*:



\* an Authorization Engine,

\* a Verification Engine,

\* an AI model,

\* a Workflow Engine,

\* an Execution Engine,

\* a Policy Authoring Tool.



Its responsibility is limited to evaluating organizational policy.



\---



\# Guarantees



The Policy Engine guarantees:



\* Every evaluation uses an explicit Policy Reference.

\* Every evaluation uses a specific policy version.

\* Policy Definitions remain immutable during evaluation.

\* Equivalent inputs produce equivalent Policy Evaluation Results.

\* Policy evaluation is independent of storage technology.

\* The Policy Evaluation Result accurately represents the evaluated policy.

\# Summary



The Policy Engine is the Parmana component responsible for evaluating organizational policy.



It resolves the Policy Reference supplied in an Execution Request, validates the corresponding Policy Definition, evaluates policy requirements against verified evidence, and produces a deterministic Policy Evaluation Result.



By separating policy evaluation from authority verification and execution orchestration, the Policy Engine provides a modular, auditable, and technology-independent implementation of organizational governance within the Parmana Runtime.
