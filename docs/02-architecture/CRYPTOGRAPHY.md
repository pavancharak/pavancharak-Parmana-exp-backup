\# Cryptography



\*\*Document:\*\* `docs/02-architecture/CRYPTOGRAPHY.md`



\## Purpose



This document defines the cryptographic architecture of Parmana.



Cryptography provides \*\*integrity\*\*, \*\*authenticity\*\*, and \*\*tamper detection\*\* for authorization artifacts produced by the Parmana Runtime.



Cryptography protects the trust established through Authority Verification. It does \*\*not\*\* establish execution authority.



This document specifies the architectural requirements and the reference implementation used by Parmana.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Overview



Parmana authorizes business operations based on organizational policy and verified evidence.



Once an Authorization Decision has been produced, the resulting authorization artifacts must be protected against:



\* Modification

\* Forgery

\* Corruption

\* Unauthorized substitution

\* Integrity loss



The Cryptography Layer provides these guarantees.



\---



\# Core Principle



Cryptography protects evidence.



Cryptography does \*\*not\*\* determine whether execution is authorized.



Authorization is established through:



\* Human Authority

\* Organizational Policy

\* Authority Verification



Cryptography ensures that the resulting authorization artifacts remain trustworthy after they have been created.



\---



\# Security Objectives



The Cryptography Layer provides the following guarantees.



\## Integrity



Detect unauthorized modification of authorization artifacts.



\---



\## Authenticity



Allow verifiers to confirm that an authorization artifact originated from Parmana.



\---



\## Tamper Detection



Detect any unauthorized change to persisted records or receipts.



\---



\## Independent Verification



Enable third parties to verify authorization artifacts without trusting the original Runtime instance.



\---



\## Replay Support



Ensure replay operates on cryptographically protected authorization evidence.



\---



\# Protected Artifacts



Cryptographic protection applies to:



\* Execution Trust Records

\* Execution Receipts

\* Verification metadata (where applicable)

\* Replay artifacts (where applicable)



Business Transactions and Execution Requests are protected indirectly through the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Reference Algorithms



The current Parmana reference implementation uses the following algorithms.



| Purpose            | Algorithm |

| ------------------ | --------- |

| Hashing            | SHA-256   |

| Digital Signatures | Ed25519   |



Future implementations may introduce additional algorithms while preserving compatibility and verification guarantees.



\---



\# Hashing



\## Purpose



Hashing produces a deterministic digest representing the contents of an authorization artifact.



The hash enables detection of unauthorized modification.



\---



\## Algorithm



Reference implementation:



```text

SHA-256

```



\---



\## Properties



The hash must be:



\* Deterministic

\* Collision-resistant

\* Stable

\* Independent of storage implementation



Equivalent authorization artifacts produce identical hashes.



\---



\# Canonical Serialization



Before hashing, authorization artifacts MUST be serialized into a canonical representation.



Canonical serialization ensures that:



\* equivalent records produce identical hashes,

\* formatting differences do not affect integrity,

\* replay remains deterministic.



The reference implementation uses canonical JSON serialization compliant with \*\*RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme)\*\*.



\---



\# Hash Generation



Conceptually:



```text

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Canonical Serialization

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

SHA-256

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Record Hash

```



The generated hash becomes part of the authorization evidence.



\---



\# Digital Signatures



\## Purpose



Digital signatures provide authenticity.



They enable verifiers to determine whether an authorization artifact was issued by Parmana.



\---



\## Algorithm



Reference implementation:



```text

Ed25519

```



\---



\## Signature Process



Conceptually:



```text

Record Hash

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Private Key

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Digital Signature

```



The resulting signature accompanies the protected artifact.



\---



\# Signature Verification



Verification uses the corresponding public key.



Conceptually:



```text

Execution Receipt

&#x20;        │

&#x20;        ▼

Extract Signature

&#x20;        │

&#x20;        ▼

Public Key

&#x20;        │

&#x20;        ▼

Verify Signature

&#x20;        │

&#x20;        ▼

Valid / Invalid

```



Successful verification confirms:



\* integrity,

\* authenticity,

\* absence of unauthorized modification.



\---



\# Key Management



Cryptographic keys are managed separately from authorization logic.



The Runtime requires:



\* private keys for signing,

\* public keys for verification.



Key storage mechanisms are deployment-specific.



Examples include:



\* Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)

\* Cloud Key Management Services (KMS)

\* Secure software key stores



The Runtime should never embed private keys within application source code.



\---



\# Cryptographic Workflow



The Runtime performs cryptographic operations after successful Authority Verification.



```text

Authority Verification

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Authorization Decision

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Canonical Serialization

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

SHA-256 Hash

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Ed25519 Signature

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Execution Receipt

```



Cryptography protects completed authorization artifacts.



\---



\# Replay Protection



Replay relies on cryptographic integrity.



During replay:



\* the stored artifact is retrieved,

\* canonical serialization is performed,

\* the hash is recomputed,

\* signatures are verified,

\* authorization evidence is validated.



Replay fails if integrity verification fails.



\---



\# Cryptographic Metadata



Protected artifacts may contain metadata including:



\* Hash algorithm

\* Signature algorithm

\* Signature value

\* Key identifier

\* Integrity version



Metadata supports future algorithm evolution.



\---



\# Algorithm Agility



Parmana is designed to support future cryptographic algorithms.



Implementations should identify:



\* hash algorithm,

\* signature algorithm,

\* key version.



This enables algorithm upgrades without invalidating historical authorization artifacts.



\---



\# Failure Conditions



Cryptographic verification fails when:



\* hashes differ,

\* signatures are invalid,

\* unsupported algorithms are encountered,

\* required keys are unavailable,

\* canonical serialization fails.



Cryptographic failure prevents successful verification.



\---



\# Security Considerations



Private keys should be protected against:



\* unauthorized access,

\* disclosure,

\* modification,

\* accidental deletion.



Public verification keys should be distributed securely to authorized verifiers.



Key rotation policies are deployment-specific.



\---



\# Design Principles



The Cryptography Layer follows these principles:



\* Deterministic hashing.

\* Strong digital signatures.

\* Canonical serialization.

\* Algorithm independence.

\* Independent verification.

\* Technology independence.

\* Tamper detection.

\* Future algorithm agility.



\---



\# What Cryptography Is Not



The Cryptography Layer is \*\*not\*\*:



\* an authorization engine,

\* a policy engine,

\* an identity system,

\* a workflow engine,

\* a trust model.



It protects authorization artifacts after they have been produced.



\---



\# Guarantees



The Cryptography Layer guarantees:



\* Unauthorized modification is detectable.

\* Execution Trust Records have stable cryptographic hashes.

\* Execution Receipts are digitally signed.

\* Authorization artifacts support independent verification.

\* Replay validates artifact integrity.

\* Equivalent authorization artifacts produce identical hashes through canonical serialization.

\* Historical authorization artifacts remain verifiable across supported algorithm versions.

\# Current Reference Implementation



The current Parmana reference implementation uses:



| Component                   | Implementation                          |

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| Canonical Serialization     | RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme) |

| Hash Algorithm              | SHA-256                                 |

| Digital Signature Algorithm | Ed25519                                 |

| Hash Target                 | Execution Trust Record                  |

| Signature Target            | Canonical Execution Receipt             |



These implementation choices define the reference implementation and may evolve provided future implementations preserve the architectural guarantees defined in this specification.



\---



\# Summary



The Cryptography Layer protects the integrity and authenticity of Parmana authorization artifacts.



By combining canonical serialization, SHA-256 hashing, and Ed25519 digital signatures, Parmana enables Execution Trust Records and Execution Receipts to remain tamper-evident, independently verifiable, and suitable for replay, audit, and long-term compliance.



Cryptography does not authorize execution. It preserves the integrity of the authorization evidence produced by the Parmana Runtime.
