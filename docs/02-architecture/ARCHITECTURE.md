\# Architecture



\*\*Document:\*\* `docs/02-architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`



\## Purpose



This document defines the reference architecture of Parmana.



It describes the major architectural components, their responsibilities, their relationships, and the overall execution flow.



The architecture is implementation-independent. It specifies the logical structure of the Parmana platform rather than a particular programming language, deployment model, or storage technology.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Overview



Parmana is an \*\*Execution Authorization and Verification Infrastructure for Enterprise AI\*\*.



Its purpose is to ensure that high-impact business operations are executed only after organizational authority has been verified through explicit policy evaluation and trusted evidence.



Parmana does \*\*not\*\* execute business operations.



Parmana authorizes business operations.



Execution is performed by external execution systems after successful authorization.



\---



\# Architectural Principles



The Parmana architecture is built upon the following principles.



\## Separation of Concerns



Each architectural component has one clearly defined responsibility.



Examples:



\* Policy evaluation

\* Authority verification

\* Persistence

\* Cryptographic integrity

\* Receipt generation



Responsibilities do not overlap.



\---



\## Separation of Intelligence and Authority



AI systems may determine:



> What should happen.



Parmana determines:



> Whether the organization authorizes it.



Reasoning and authority remain separate.



\---



\## Deterministic Authorization



Equivalent inputs must produce equivalent Authorization Decisions.



Determinism enables:



\* Replay

\* Independent verification

\* Compliance

\* Audit



\---



\## Evidence-Based Trust



Authorization is based on verified evidence rather than assumptions.



Evidence includes:



\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Organizational Policy



\---



\## Technology Independence



The logical architecture does not depend upon:



\* Programming language

\* Database

\* Cloud provider

\* AI model

\* Workflow platform



Implementations may vary while preserving architectural behavior.

\# Architectural Layers



Parmana is organized into six logical layers.



\## Layer 1 — Request Layer



Responsible for receiving Execution Requests.



Primary responsibilities:



\* API

\* Request validation

\* Authentication

\* Request normalization



Output:



\* Execution Request



\---



\## Layer 2 — Authorization Layer



The core of Parmana.



Responsible for:



\* Policy evaluation

\* Signal evaluation

\* Authority Verification

\* Authorization Decision



Output:



\* Authorization Decision



\---



\## Layer 3 — Trust Layer



Responsible for creating authorization evidence.



Produces:



\* Execution Trust Record

\* Execution Receipt



Provides:



\* Replay

\* Verification

\* Audit



\---



\## Layer 4 — Repository Layer



Provides persistence abstractions.



Responsibilities include:



\* Store records

\* Retrieve records

\* Query records

\* Maintain storage independence



\---



\## Layer 5 — Storage Layer



Responsible for physical persistence.



Examples:



\* PostgreSQL

\* Supabase

\* Future storage implementations



Storage technologies do not affect authorization behavior.



\---



\## Layer 6 — Integrity Layer



Provides cryptographic protection.



Responsibilities include:



\* Hashing

\* Digital signatures

\* Integrity verification



Integrity protects evidence.



It does not establish authority.



\---



\# Core Components



\## Execution Engine



Coordinates the complete authorization workflow.



Responsibilities:



\* Runtime orchestration

\* Stage management

\* Error handling

\* Lifecycle control



\---



\## Policy Engine



Evaluates Organizational Policies.



Responsibilities:



\* Resolve Policy References

\* Evaluate rules

\* Apply constraints

\* Determine policy compliance



\---



\## Verification Engine



Implements Authority Verification.



Responsibilities:



\* Validate evidence

\* Verify Human Authority

\* Evaluate Enterprise Facts

\* Evaluate AI-Derived Signals

\* Produce Authorization Decisions



\---



\## Repository



Provides the persistence abstraction.



The Runtime communicates only with the Repository.



The Runtime never depends directly upon storage technologies.



\---



\## Storage



Persists authorization artifacts.



Examples include:



\* Execution Trust Records

\* Receipts

\* Metadata



\---



\## Cryptography



Protects authorization artifacts.



Responsibilities:



\* SHA-256 hashing

\* Ed25519 signatures

\* Integrity verification



\---



\## Receipt Generation



Produces portable Execution Receipts from Execution Trust Records.



Receipts are optimized for sharing.



The Execution Trust Record remains the canonical record.



\---



\# Primary Data Flow



The logical execution flow is:



```text

Business Transaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Request

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Policy Resolution

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Signal Collection

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Authority Verification

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Authorization Decision

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution Receipt

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Execution System

```



Each stage produces deterministic outputs suitable for replay and verification.



\---



\# Component Dependencies



The dependencies between architectural components are intentionally one-directional.



```text

API

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

Runtime

&#x20;│

&#x20;├── Execution Engine

&#x20;│

&#x20;├── Policy Engine

&#x20;│

&#x20;├── Verification Engine

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

Repository

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

Storage

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

Cryptography

```



Higher layers depend only on lower abstractions.



Lower layers never depend on higher layers.



\---



\# Trust Boundaries



Parmana defines three trust boundaries.



\## External Boundary



AI systems and enterprise applications may propose execution.



They do not authorize execution.



\---



\## Authorization Boundary



Authority Verification determines whether execution is permitted.



This is the primary trust boundary.



\---



\## Execution Boundary



Execution systems consume Authorization Decisions.



Execution occurs only after successful authorization.



\---



\# Architectural Guarantees



The architecture provides the following guarantees:



\* AI systems never authorize their own actions.

\* Organizational Policy governs every authorization.

\* Human Authority remains the ultimate source of execution authority.

\* Authorization Decisions are deterministic.

\* Authorization evidence is immutable.

\* Execution Trust Records are the canonical source of truth.

\* Execution Receipts are derived from Execution Trust Records.

\* Authorization is independently verifiable.

\* Replay reproduces Authorization Decisions.

\* Runtime components remain independent of storage implementations.



\---



\# Extensibility



The architecture supports extension through well-defined interfaces.



Examples include:



\* New policy engines

\* Alternative storage implementations

\* Additional signal providers

\* New cryptographic algorithms

\* Additional SDKs

\* Alternative deployment environments



Extensions must preserve the architectural guarantees defined in this document.

\# Summary



The Parmana architecture separates AI reasoning from execution authority by introducing an independent authorization and verification layer between AI systems and enterprise execution systems.



Rather than trusting AI outputs directly, Parmana evaluates Execution Requests against organizational policies, verified enterprise evidence, and required human authority to produce deterministic Authorization Decisions.



The resulting Execution Trust Record becomes the canonical evidence of authorization, while the Execution Receipt provides a portable, cryptographically verifiable proof that can be consumed by external systems.



This architecture enables organizations to deploy autonomous AI into high-impact business workflows while preserving governance, accountability, and independent verification.
