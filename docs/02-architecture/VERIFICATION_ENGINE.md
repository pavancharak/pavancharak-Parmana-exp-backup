\# Verification Engine



\*\*Document:\*\* `docs/02-architecture/VERIFICATION\_ENGINE.md`



\## Purpose



This document defines the \*\*Verification Engine\*\*, the Parmana Runtime component responsible for implementing \*\*Authority Verification\*\* and producing the \*\*Authorization Decision\*\*.



The Verification Engine combines the Policy Evaluation Result with verified evidence to determine whether an Execution Request is authorized.



It is the architectural implementation of the \*\*Authority Verification\*\* concept defined in `01-concepts/AUTHORITY\_VERIFICATION.md`.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Overview



The Verification Engine is the authorization core of the Parmana Runtime.



Its responsibility is to determine whether execution is permitted by evaluating:



\* The Execution Request

\* The Policy Evaluation Result

\* Verified Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Execution Context



The output of the Verification Engine is a single \*\*Authorization Decision\*\*.



The Verification Engine never executes business operations.



\---



\# Responsibilities



The Verification Engine is responsible for:



\* Implementing Authority Verification.

\* Validating authorization evidence.

\* Confirming Human Authority.

\* Evaluating the Policy Evaluation Result.

\* Producing the Authorization Decision.

\* Recording verification metadata.

\* Returning deterministic verification results.



The Verification Engine does \*\*not\*\*:



\* Resolve policies.

\* Persist records.

\* Generate receipts.

\* Execute workflows.

\* Perform business operations.

```



The Verification Engine is the final decision-making component within the authorization pipeline.



\---



\# Core Principle



The Verification Engine answers one question:



> \*\*"Is this Execution Request authorized to execute?"\*\*



The answer is based entirely on:



\* Organizational Policy

\* Verified Evidence

\* Human Authority



The answer is never based solely on AI reasoning.



\---



\# Inputs



The Verification Engine evaluates the following inputs.



\## Execution Request



Provides:



\* Business Transaction

\* Requested Action

\* Requesting Principal

\* Policy Reference

\* Execution Context



\---



\## Policy Evaluation Result



Produced by the Policy Engine.



Contains:



\* Policy evaluation outcome

\* Satisfied requirements

\* Unsatisfied requirements

\* Evaluation metadata



The Verification Engine does not re-evaluate policy.



\---



\## Enterprise Facts



Verified organizational information.



Examples include:



\* Identity

\* Budget

\* Role

\* Department

\* Purchase order

\* Customer status



Enterprise Facts remain authoritative.



\---



\## Human Authority Signals



Examples include:



\* Manager approval

\* Executive approval

\* Compliance approval

\* Manual override



Human Authority remains the ultimate source of execution authority.



\---



\## AI-Derived Signals



Examples include:



\* Risk score

\* Fraud analysis

\* Classification

\* Recommendation

\* Confidence



AI-Derived Signals support verification.



They never independently authorize execution.



\---



\## Execution Context



Execution Context includes:



\* Organization

\* Environment

\* Timestamp

\* Tenant

\* Request metadata



Context provides additional information used during verification.



\---



\# Verification Process



The Verification Engine performs the following logical stages.



```text id="6b7l3g"

Receive Inputs

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Validate Evidence

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verify Human Authority

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Evaluate Policy Result

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Evaluate Constraints

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Produce Authorization Decision

```



Each stage executes deterministically.



\---



\# Evidence Validation



Before authorization begins, the Verification Engine validates that:



\* required evidence exists,

\* evidence integrity is intact,

\* evidence is complete,

\* evidence satisfies policy requirements.



Incomplete evidence prevents authorization.



\---



\# Human Authority Verification



Where organizational policy requires approval, the Verification Engine confirms that:



\* required approvals exist,

\* delegated authority is valid,

\* approval requirements are satisfied.



Missing required authority prevents authorization.



\---



\# Constraint Verification



The Verification Engine evaluates operational constraints.



Examples include:



\* Financial limits

\* Regulatory restrictions

\* Organizational boundaries

\* Separation of duties

\* Risk thresholds



Constraints originate from policy.



\---



\# Authorization Decision



After verification completes, the Verification Engine produces one Authorization Decision.



Canonical outcomes include:



\* Approved

\* Rejected

\* Awaiting Approval

\* Escalated



Only one outcome is produced for each Execution Request.



\---



\# Verification Metadata



The Verification Engine records metadata describing the verification process.



Examples include:



\* Verification timestamp

\* Runtime version

\* Verification duration

\* Decision identifier

\* Processing metadata



Metadata supports replay and operational analysis.



\---



\# Determinism



The Verification Engine is deterministic.



Given identical:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Evaluation Result

\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals

\* Execution Context



the Authorization Decision must be identical.



Implementation details must not affect observable behavior.



\---



\# Failure Conditions



Verification fails when:



\* required evidence is missing,

\* evidence integrity fails,

\* Human Authority requirements are not satisfied,

\* policy evaluation cannot be completed,

\* constraints are violated,

\* authorization conditions remain unsatisfied.



Verification failure is an authorization outcome, not necessarily a system failure.



\---



\# Relationship to Policy Engine



The Verification Engine consumes the Policy Evaluation Result.

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization Decision

```



The Policy Engine evaluates policy.



The Verification Engine determines authorization.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution Trust Record



Every completed Authorization Decision becomes part of an Execution Trust Record.



The Verification Engine provides:



\* Authorization Decision

\* Verification metadata

\* Evaluated evidence references



The Repository persists the resulting record.



\---



\# Security Considerations



The Verification Engine protects against:



\* unauthorized execution,

\* missing approvals,

\* forged evidence,

\* invalid policy results,

\* evidence tampering,

\* incomplete verification.



Authorization occurs only after successful verification.



\---



\# Design Principles



The Verification Engine follows these principles:



\* Evidence-driven verification.

\* Deterministic authorization.

\* Human Authority preservation.

\* Policy-governed decisions.

\* Immutable authorization outcomes.

\* Technology independence.

\* Independent verifiability.



\---



\# What the Verification Engine Is Not



The Verification Engine is \*\*not\*\*:



\* a Policy Engine,

\* an Execution Engine,

\* a Repository,

\* an AI reasoning engine,

\* a workflow engine,

\* an execution platform.



Its sole responsibility is Authority Verification.



\---



\# Guarantees



The Verification Engine guarantees:



\* Every Authorization Decision is based on verified evidence.

\* Organizational Policy governs every authorization.

\* Human Authority requirements are enforced.

\* Enterprise Facts remain authoritative.

\* AI-Derived Signals never independently authorize execution.

\* Equivalent inputs produce equivalent Authorization Decisions.

\* Every completed verification produces one Authorization Decision.

\* Every Authorization Decision is suitable for replay and independent verification.

\# Summary



The Verification Engine is the authorization component of the Parmana Runtime.



It implements Authority Verification by combining the Policy Evaluation Result with verified Enterprise Facts, Human Authority Signals, AI-Derived Signals, and Execution Context to produce a deterministic Authorization Decision.



By separating policy evaluation from authorization and execution orchestration, the Verification Engine provides a clear, auditable, and technology-independent implementation of execution authorization while preserving the core principle of Parmana:



\*\*Organizations authorize execution. AI systems do not.\*\*
