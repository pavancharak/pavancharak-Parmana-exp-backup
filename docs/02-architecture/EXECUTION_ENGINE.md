\# Execution Engine



\*\*Document:\*\* `docs/02-architecture/EXECUTION\_ENGINE.md`



\## Purpose



This document defines the \*\*Execution Engine\*\*, the orchestration component of the Parmana Runtime.



The Execution Engine coordinates the complete authorization lifecycle. It is responsible for executing the authorization pipeline in a deterministic manner by invoking the appropriate runtime components in the correct order.



The Execution Engine does \*\*not\*\* evaluate policies, verify evidence, or execute business operations. Those responsibilities belong to specialized components.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Overview



The Execution Engine is the central orchestrator of the Parmana Runtime.



Its responsibility is to transform an incoming Execution Request into an Authorization Decision by coordinating:



\* Policy resolution

\* Signal collection

\* Authority Verification

\* Persistence

\* Receipt generation



The Execution Engine manages the execution flow.



It does not make authorization decisions.



\---



\# Responsibilities



The Execution Engine is responsible for:



\* Coordinating the authorization pipeline.

\* Managing runtime state transitions.

\* Invoking architectural components.

\* Handling runtime failures.

\* Maintaining deterministic execution order.

\* Recording execution metadata.

\* Producing a completed authorization workflow.



\---



\# Architectural Position



The Execution Engine sits at the center of the Runtime.

&#x20;            Receipt Generation

```



The Execution Engine coordinates these components without implementing their internal logic.



\---



\# Execution Lifecycle



The Execution Engine executes the following pipeline.



```text id="5e8yhn"

Receive Request

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Validate Request

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Resolve Policy

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Collect Signals

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Verify Authority

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Produce Authorization Decision

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Persist Execution Trust Record

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Generate Execution Receipt

&#x20;      │

&#x20;      ▼

Return Result

```



Every Execution Request follows this lifecycle.



\---



\# Pipeline Stages



\## Stage 1 — Request Initialization



The Execution Engine receives a validated Execution Request from the Runtime.



Responsibilities:



\* Initialize runtime context.

\* Create execution state.

\* Record processing metadata.



\---



\## Stage 2 — Policy Resolution



The Execution Engine invokes the Policy Engine.



Expected output:



\* Policy Definition

\* Policy Version

\* Evaluation requirements



The Execution Engine does not interpret policy rules.



\---



\## Stage 3 — Signal Acquisition



The Execution Engine coordinates collection of all evidence required by the Policy Definition.



Examples include:



\* Enterprise Facts

\* Human Authority Signals

\* AI-Derived Signals



Only required evidence is requested.



\---



\## Stage 4 — Authority Verification



The Execution Engine invokes the Verification Engine.



Inputs:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Definition

\* Signals

\* Execution Context



Output:



\* Authorization Decision



The Verification Engine owns authorization logic.



\---



\## Stage 5 — Record Persistence



The Execution Engine instructs the Repository to create the Execution Trust Record.



Persistence includes:



\* Authorization Decision

\* Evidence

\* Policy information

\* Verification metadata



Authorization is not considered complete until persistence succeeds.



\---



\## Stage 6 — Receipt Generation



The Execution Engine invokes the Receipt Generation component.



The generated Execution Receipt is derived from the persisted Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Stage 7 — Completion



The Execution Engine returns:



\* Authorization Decision

\* Execution Receipt

\* Processing metadata



Control returns to the requesting system.



\---



\# Execution Context



The Execution Engine maintains a runtime execution context throughout processing.



Conceptually:



```text id="m4qgzo"

Execution Context

├── Request

├── Policy

├── Signals

├── Verification State

├── Authorization Decision

├── Record Reference

└── Receipt Reference

```



The Execution Context exists only for the lifetime of a single Execution Request.



\---



\# State Machine



The Execution Engine operates as a deterministic state machine.



```text id="jjwivv"

Initialized

&#x20;     │

Validated

&#x20;     │

Policy Resolved

&#x20;     │

Signals Ready

&#x20;     │

Verified

&#x20;     │

Decision Produced

&#x20;     │

Record Persisted

&#x20;     │

Receipt Generated

&#x20;     │

Completed

```



Each state has a single valid successor.



\---



\# Failure Handling



The Execution Engine terminates processing when:



\* request validation fails,

\* policy resolution fails,

\* required signals cannot be collected,

\* verification fails,

\* persistence fails,

\* receipt generation fails.



No partially completed authorization is treated as successful.



\---



\# Component Coordination



The Execution Engine coordinates components according to the following sequence.



```text id="b6tt83"

Execution Engine

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ├── Policy Engine

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ├── Verification Engine

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ├── Repository

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     └── Receipt Generation

```



Each component performs one specialized responsibility.



The Execution Engine coordinates them.



\---



\# Determinism



The Execution Engine preserves deterministic execution.



Given identical:



\* Execution Request

\* Policy Definition

\* Signals

\* Execution Context



the pipeline executes the same sequence of operations and produces the same Authorization Decision.



Implementation optimizations must not alter observable behavior.



\---



\# Transaction Boundary



The authorization pipeline represents a logical transaction.



Successful completion requires:



\* Authorization Decision produced.

\* Execution Trust Record persisted.

\* Execution Receipt generated.



If any required stage fails, the authorization transaction is incomplete.



\---



\# Isolation



Each Execution Request is processed independently.



The Execution Engine ensures:



\* isolated execution context,

\* independent Authorization Decisions,

\* independent persistence,

\* independent receipts.



Concurrent requests do not share authorization state.



\---



\# Observability



The Execution Engine should expose operational information such as:



\* Processing duration

\* Pipeline stage

\* Failure reason

\* Component latency

\* Request correlation identifier



Operational metrics do not influence authorization decisions.



\---



\# Security Considerations



The Execution Engine must ensure that:



\* pipeline stages execute in the correct order,

\* authorization cannot be bypassed,

\* incomplete authorization cannot proceed,

\* unauthorized execution cannot occur,

\* runtime failures cannot produce false approvals.



\---



\# Design Principles



The Execution Engine follows these principles:



\* Single orchestration responsibility.

\* Deterministic execution.

\* Stateless request processing.

\* Component isolation.

\* Explicit stage transitions.

\* Fail-safe behavior.

\* Technology independence.



\---



\# What the Execution Engine Is Not



The Execution Engine is \*\*not\*\*:



\* a Policy Engine,

\* a Verification Engine,

\* a Repository,

\* a Storage system,

\* an Execution System,

\* a Workflow Engine,

\* an AI model.



Its sole responsibility is orchestration.



\---



\# Guarantees



The Execution Engine guarantees:



\* Every Execution Request follows the same authorization pipeline.

\* Pipeline stages execute in a deterministic order.

\* Authorization cannot bypass required stages.

\* Every completed authorization produces one Execution Trust Record.

\* Every Execution Receipt is generated from a persisted Execution Trust Record.

\* Failed pipelines never produce successful authorization outcomes.



\---

\* `VERIFICATION\_ENGINE.md`

\# Summary



The Execution Engine is the orchestration component of the Parmana Runtime.



It coordinates the complete authorization lifecycle by executing a deterministic pipeline that resolves policies, gathers evidence, invokes Authority Verification, persists the resulting Execution Trust Record, and generates an Execution Receipt.



By separating orchestration from policy evaluation, verification, persistence, and cryptography, the Execution Engine maintains a clear separation of responsibilities while ensuring that every Execution Request follows the same reliable and auditable authorization process.
