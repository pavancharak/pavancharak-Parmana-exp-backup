\# Decision Record: Canonical Policy Language v1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted

\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-07-04

\*\*Decision Type:\*\* Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

\# Title



Adopt a Canonical Policy Language for Parmana



\---



\# Context



The initial implementation of the Policy Engine supported a minimal policy syntax:



```json

{

&#x20; "signal": "vendorVerified",

&#x20; "equals": true

}

```



and



```json

{

&#x20; "signal": "amount",

&#x20; "greater\_than": 1000

}

```



This syntax was sufficient for early prototypes but became inadequate as Parmana expanded to support multiple enterprise domains including:



\* AI Governance

\* Multi-Agent Systems

\* Banking

\* Healthcare

\* DevOps

\* Enterprise Security

\* Autonomous Systems



The new policy library introduced a richer syntax based on:



```json

{

&#x20; "fact": "...",

&#x20; "operator": "...",

&#x20; "value": ...

}

```



During implementation it became clear that the existing Policy Engine and the new policy library were incompatible.



\---



\# Decision



Parmana shall adopt a single canonical policy language.



The previous policy syntax using



```json

signal

equals

greater\_than

```



is deprecated and will be removed before v1.0 release.



All policies shall use the canonical format.



\---



\# Canonical Leaf Condition



Every leaf condition SHALL be represented as



```json

{

&#x20; "fact": "riskScore",

&#x20; "operator": "lte",

&#x20; "value": 25

}

```



\---



\# Canonical Logical Conditions



AND



```json

{

&#x20; "all": \[

&#x20;   {

&#x20;     "fact": "toolAllowed",

&#x20;     "operator": "eq",

&#x20;     "value": true

&#x20;   },

&#x20;   {

&#x20;     "fact": "riskScore",

&#x20;     "operator": "lte",

&#x20;     "value": 25

&#x20;   }

&#x20; ]

}

```



OR



```json

{

&#x20; "any": \[

&#x20;   ...

&#x20; ]

}

```



Nested logical conditions are permitted.



\---



\# Supported Operators (v1)



The Policy Engine SHALL support the following deterministic operators.



| Operator   | Description                            |

| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |

| eq         | equals                                 |

| neq        | not equals                             |

| gt         | greater than                           |

| gte        | greater than or equal                  |

| lt         | less than                              |

| lte        | less than or equal                     |

| in         | value exists within collection         |

| not\_in     | value does not exist within collection |

| exists     | fact exists                            |

| not\_exists | fact does not exist                    |



Future operators may be added in later schema versions.



\---



\# Determinism Requirements



Changing the policy language SHALL NOT affect determinism.



The Policy Engine SHALL remain a pure deterministic evaluator.



Given identical



\* Policy

\* Policy Version

\* Schema Version

\* Runtime Signals

\* Policy Engine Version



the engine SHALL always produce identical



\* Decision

\* Outcome

\* Matched Rule

\* Reason

\* Evaluation Trace



\---



\# Determinism Rules



The Policy Engine SHALL NOT



\* call LLMs

\* call external APIs

\* query databases

\* use current timestamps

\* generate random numbers

\* mutate runtime state



Policy evaluation SHALL depend exclusively upon



\* Policy

\* Runtime Signals



\---



\# Evaluation Order



Policy evaluation SHALL remain deterministic.



Rules SHALL be evaluated sequentially.



The first matching rule SHALL determine the decision.



\---



\# Runtime Responsibilities



The Policy Engine SHALL



\* evaluate policies

\* evaluate logical conditions

\* evaluate operators

\* return deterministic decisions



The Policy Engine SHALL NOT



\* authorize execution

\* execute business actions

\* invoke AI models

\* create trust records

\* perform replay

\* generate receipts



\---



\# Engine Refactoring



The engine SHALL be refactored into deterministic stages.



```text

PolicyEngine

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

evaluate()

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

findFirstMatch()

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

evaluateCondition()

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

evaluateLeaf()

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

evaluateOperator()

```



Operator evaluation SHALL be isolated into a dedicated component.



\---



\# Policy Versioning



Policy versions remain independent of schema versions.



Example



```json

{

&#x20;   "policyId": "vendor-payment",

&#x20;   "policyVersion": "2.0.0",

&#x20;   "schemaVersion": "1.0.0"

}

```



Future language changes SHALL increment



```

schemaVersion

```



rather than policy versions.



\---



\# Migration



Before Parmana v1.0 release



\* migrate all bundled policies

\* remove legacy syntax

\* remove legacy evaluator

\* update SDK examples

\* update documentation



No backward compatibility is required because Parmana has no production customers and no public compatibility commitments.



\---



\# Consequences



\## Benefits



\* Single policy language

\* Consistent SDK examples

\* Simpler documentation

\* Extensible operator model

\* Better readability

\* Easier policy authoring

\* Enterprise-ready policy framework

\* Preserves deterministic replay



\## Costs



\* One-time migration of bundled policies

\* Refactoring of Policy Engine

\* Update of policy documentation

\* Update of SDK examples



\---



\# Architecture Principle



> \*\*Policy Language is part of Parmana's public contract.\*\*

>

> The language SHALL remain deterministic, versioned, replayable, auditable, and independent of execution, authorization, and trust record generation.
