\# Parmana Audit Guide



Version: 1.0



Status: Normative



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the audit methodology for the Parmana Execution Trust Infrastructure.



Its purpose is to ensure that architectural guarantees are validated through repeatable, evidence-based review rather than assumptions.



Individual audit reports are maintained separately.



\---



\# Audit Objectives



An audit evaluates whether the implementation preserves the execution trust model defined by Parmana.



Audits are intended to determine whether:



\* the implementation conforms to the specification

\* execution trust guarantees are implemented

\* execution evidence can be verified

\* documented claims are supported by evidence



\---



\# Audit Scope



Audits may include review of:



\* architecture

\* specification

\* runtime

\* policy engine

\* crypto

\* replay

\* API

\* documentation

\* guarantees

\* proofs

\* conformance tests



\---



\# Audit Principles



\## Evidence-Based



Every audit finding SHOULD be supported by implementation evidence.



\---



\## Reproducible



Independent reviewers SHOULD be able to reproduce audit findings.



\---



\## Traceable



Every finding SHOULD reference:



\* implementation

\* guarantee

\* proof

\* test

\* documentation



\---



\## Independent



Audits SHOULD evaluate observable implementation behavior rather than developer intent.



\---



\# Audit Lifecycle



Every audit follows the same process.

\# Audit Areas



\## Architecture



Verify:



\* package responsibilities

\* trust chain

\* separation of concerns

\* execution lifecycle



\---



\## Specification



Verify that implementation conforms to:



\* SPECIFICATION.md



\---



\## Trust Model



Verify:



\* Authority relationships

\* Authorization relationships

\* Intent relationships

\* Policy binding

\* execution trust chain



\---



\## Runtime



Verify:



\* validation

\* execution lifecycle

\* runtime pipeline

\* execution ordering



\---



\## Policy



Verify:



\* policy loading

\* policy validation

\* deterministic evaluation



\---



\## Crypto



Verify:



\* hashing

\* signatures

\* verification



\---



\## Replay



Verify:



\* replay behavior

\* comparison logic

\* preservation of evidence



\---



\## API



Verify:



\* execution entry points

\* verification endpoints

\* replay endpoints



\---



\## Documentation



Verify consistency between:



\* implementation

\* guarantees

\* proofs

\* claims



\---



\# Guarantee Audit



Every guarantee SHOULD be reviewed.



The audit SHALL determine:



\* implemented

\* tested

\* audited

\* independently verifiable



Audit results SHOULD update `PROOFS.md`.



\---



\# Audit Evidence



Evidence may include:



\* source code

\* automated tests

\* integration tests

\* negative tests

\* conformance results

\* execution artifacts

\* Trust Records

\* Receipts



Evidence SHOULD be referenced rather than duplicated.



\---



\# Audit Findings



Findings SHOULD be classified.



\## Proven



Implementation and evidence fully support the guarantee.



\---



\## Partial



Implementation exists but evidence is incomplete.



Examples:



\* missing integration tests

\* missing negative tests

\* missing independent verification



\---



\## Pending



Implementation or evidence is incomplete.



\---



\## Not Supported



Implementation does not support the documented guarantee.



Claims SHOULD NOT be made until the finding is resolved.



\---



\# Audit Report Template



Each audit SHOULD include:



\* Audit identifier

\* Scope

\* Date

\* Version

\* Reviewer

\* Reviewed guarantees

\* Findings

\* Recommendations

\* Evidence references



\---



\# Audit Frequency



Audits SHOULD be performed:



\* before major releases

\* after significant architectural changes

\* after security-sensitive changes

\* before promoting new public technical claims



\---



\# Relationship to Other Documents



\* `SPECIFICATION.md` defines expected behavior.

\* `GUARANTEES.md` defines required properties.

\* `PROOFS.md` records evidence.

\* `CLAIMS.md` defines public technical claims.

\* `CONFORMANCE.md` defines compatibility requirements.



Individual audit reports are stored separately, for example:



```text id="0s5n1m"

examples/

└── audit/

&#x20;   ├── AS-001/

&#x20;   ├── AS-002/

&#x20;   └── ...

```



\---



\# Guiding Principle



Audits do not establish trust by assertion.



They establish trust by evaluating implementation against the specification, validating guarantees with evidence, and documenting findings that independent reviewers can reproduce.



Every public technical claim should ultimately be traceable through:



```text id="k1q4yb"

Claim

&#x20;   ↓

Guarantee

&#x20;   ↓

Proof

&#x20;   ↓

Audit

&#x20;   ↓

Implementation

```



This traceability is the foundation of evidence-backed execution trust.
