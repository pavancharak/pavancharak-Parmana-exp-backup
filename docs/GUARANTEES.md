\# Parmana Guarantees



Version: 1.0



Status: Normative



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the execution trust guarantees provided by Parmana.



A guarantee represents a verifiable property of the architecture that is expected to hold for every conforming implementation.



Each guarantee SHALL be supported by:



\* implementation

\* automated tests

\* audit evidence

\* documented proof

\* independent verification where applicable



The implementation status and evidence for each guarantee are documented in `PROOFS.md`.



\---



\# Guarantee Model



Every guarantee progresses through the following lifecycle.



```text

Specification

&#x20;     ↓

Implementation

&#x20;     ↓

Unit Tests

&#x20;     ↓

Integration Tests

&#x20;     ↓

Audit

&#x20;     ↓

Proof

&#x20;     ↓

Release

```



A guarantee SHOULD NOT be considered complete until all stages have been satisfied.

\# G-00 — Trust Architecture



\## Statement



Parmana models execution as an explicit trust chain rather than a sequence of runtime events.



Every execution artifact has an explicit predecessor.



\## Purpose



Provide a canonical execution model that links authorization, policy evaluation, execution, evidence generation, verification, and replay.



\## Evidence



\* Trust model

\* Canonical domain model

\* Architecture



\---



\# G-01 — Trusted Business Transaction



\## Statement



Every execution originates from a validated Business Transaction.



\## Guarantee



The runtime validates trust-chain consistency before execution begins.



Required relationships include:



\* Authority → Authorization

\* Authorization → Intent

\* BusinessTransaction → Metadata

\* BusinessTransaction → PolicyReference



\## Evidence



\* BusinessTransactionValidator



\---



\# G-02 — Deterministic Policy Selection



\## Statement



Every Business Transaction references exactly one Policy.



\## Guarantee



The runtime:



\* MUST load the referenced policy.

\* MUST validate its identity.

\* MUST validate its version.

\* MUST NOT discover or substitute policies.



\## Evidence



\* PolicyRouter

\* PolicyValidator



\---



\# G-03 — Deterministic Policy Evaluation



\## Statement



Policy evaluation is deterministic.



\## Guarantee



The Policy Engine:



\* evaluates rules sequentially

\* stops at the first matching rule

\* records evaluation trace

\* records matched rule

\* records decision reason



\## Evidence



\* PolicyEngine



\---



\# G-04 — Authorized Execution



\## Statement



Execution occurs only after trust validation and an approved decision.



\## Guarantee



Execution SHALL NOT proceed when:



\* Authority is missing

\* Authorization is missing

\* Intent is missing

\* Policy is missing

\* Decision is absent

\* Decision outcome is not approved



\## Evidence



\* TrustChainValidationComponent



\---



\# G-05 — Execution Trust Record Integrity



\## Statement



Every successful execution produces immutable execution evidence.



\## Guarantee



Execution Trust Records include the artifacts necessary to verify execution integrity.



Execution Trust Records SHALL be treated as immutable.



\## Evidence



\* ExecutionTrustRecordBuilder



\---



\# G-06 — Receipt Authenticity



\## Statement



Every Receipt is cryptographically verifiable.



\## Guarantee



Receipts contain:



\* Trust Record reference

\* Digital signature

\* Signature metadata



Receipt integrity can be verified independently.



\## Evidence



\* ReceiptCrypto



\---



\# G-07 — Independent Verification



\## Statement



Execution evidence can be verified independently of the original runtime.



\## Guarantee



Verification confirms execution integrity without modifying execution evidence.



\## Evidence



\* VerificationComponent

\* VerificationCrypto



\---



\# G-08 — Deterministic Replay



\## Statement



Recorded executions can be replayed for verification and analysis.



\## Guarantee



Replay re-evaluates historical execution without modifying historical evidence.



Replay is intended to detect meaningful differences between recorded and replayed execution.



\## Evidence



\* Replay package



\---



\# G-09 — API Enforcement



\## Statement



The Parmana API serves as the supported entry point into the execution trust infrastructure.



\## Guarantee



Execution requests submitted through the API are processed by the Runtime Engine and its trust validation process.



\## Evidence



\* API package

\* Runtime package



\---



\# G-10 — End-to-End Execution Trust



\## Statement



Parmana establishes a continuous execution trust chain from business authorization to verification.



\## Guarantee



Execution proceeds through the following lifecycle:



```text

Authority

&#x20;   ↓

Authorization

&#x20;   ↓

Intent

&#x20;   ↓

Business Transaction

&#x20;   ↓

Policy Reference

&#x20;   ↓

Policy

&#x20;   ↓

Decision

&#x20;   ↓

Execution

&#x20;   ↓

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;   ↓

Receipt

&#x20;   ↓

Verification

&#x20;   ↓

Replay

```



Each downstream artifact is logically derived from upstream trust artifacts.



\## Evidence



\* Canonical trust model

\* Runtime

\* Policy

\* Crypto

\* Replay



\---



\# Guarantee Status



Each guarantee has a corresponding proof document that records:



\* implementation status

\* test coverage

\* audit status

\* proof status

\* independent verification status



The authoritative status for each guarantee is maintained in `PROOFS.md`.



\---



\# Engineering Principle



Guarantees define what Parmana is expected to provide.



Claims describe what Parmana publicly communicates.



Proofs demonstrate that guarantees are supported by implementation evidence.



Every public claim SHOULD be traceable to one or more guarantees, and every guarantee SHOULD be traceable to implementation, tests, audit evidence, and documented proof.
