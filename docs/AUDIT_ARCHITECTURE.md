\# Architecture Audit



\*\*Version:\*\* v1 Foundation  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-07-03



\---



\# Purpose



This document audits the architecture of the Parmana Execution Trust Platform.



The objective is to evaluate whether the system architecture supports:



\- correctness

\- determinism

\- maintainability

\- extensibility

\- security

\- enterprise evolution



without requiring future architectural redesign.



\---



\# Architectural Vision



Parmana is designed as an \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\* rather than an execution engine.



The architecture separates:



\- execution

\- persistence

\- cryptography

\- verification

\- replay



into independent layers with well-defined responsibilities.



This separation enables future enterprise capabilities to be added without modifying the core trust model.

\# Architectural Principles



The architecture follows these principles:



\- Single Responsibility

\- Separation of Concerns

\- Immutable Evidence

\- Deterministic Processing

\- Layer Isolation

\- Dependency Inversion

\- Repository Abstraction

\- Replaceable Infrastructure



\---



\# Layer Audit



\## REST API



\### Responsibility



Expose HTTP endpoints.



Responsibilities include:



\- request validation

\- request mapping

\- response serialization



The API layer contains no business logic.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\## Application Layer



\### Responsibility



Coordinates complete business workflows.



Current workflows include:



\- Execute

\- Verify

\- Receipt

\- Replay



Responsibilities include:



\- orchestration

\- lifecycle coordination

\- workflow sequencing



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\## Runtime Layer



\### Responsibility



Executes Business Transactions.



Produces:



\- Decisions

\- Executions

\- Execution Trust Records



The Runtime is independent of storage and transport.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\## Repository Layer



\### Responsibility



Persists and reconstructs immutable Execution Trust Records.



Current implementation:



\- create()

\- appendExecution()

\- appendVerification()

\- appendReceipt()

\- appendOverride()

\- findByTransactionId()



Repository abstraction allows storage implementations to change without affecting higher layers.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\## Storage Layer



Current implementation:



Supabase



Artifacts stored:



\- execution\_trust\_records

\- executions

\- overrides

\- verifications

\- receipts



Storage is isolated behind repository interfaces.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\## Cryptography Layer



Responsibilities:



\- canonical serialization

\- hashing

\- signing

\- verification



Implemented algorithms:



\- SHA-256

\- Ed25519



Cryptography is isolated from runtime logic.



Status:



\*\*Complete\*\*



\---



\# Execution Flow



Current execution lifecycle:



```

Business Transaction



↓



Execute



↓



Decision



↓



Execution



↓



Execution Trust Record



↓



Verification



↓



Receipt



↓



Replay

```



Each step produces immutable evidence.



\---



\# Repository Reconstruction



Execution Trust Records are reconstructed from multiple persistence tables.



```

execution\_trust\_records



\+



executions



\+



overrides



\+



verifications



\+



receipts



↓



Execution Trust Record

```



This reconstruction is deterministic.



\---



\# Dependency Direction



Dependencies flow downward.



```

API



↓



Application



↓



Runtime



↓



Repository



↓



Storage



↓



Infrastructure

```



Lower layers never depend on higher layers.



This prevents cyclic dependencies.



\---



\# Package Structure



Current packages:



```

packages/



api/



runtime/



storage/



crypto/



shared/



sdk/

```



Each package has a clearly defined responsibility.



\---



\# Data Ownership



\## Runtime



Owns:



\- execution



\---



\## Repository



Owns:



\- persistence



\---



\## Crypto



Owns:



\- signatures

\- hashing

\- serialization



\---



\## API



Owns:



\- transport



\---



\# Extensibility



The architecture allows future replacement of:



Storage



Current:



\- Supabase



Future:



\- PostgreSQL

\- DynamoDB

\- CockroachDB



\---



Cryptography



Current:



\- SHA-256

\- Ed25519



Future:



\- Dilithium

\- HSM

\- Cloud KMS



\---



API



Current:



REST



Future:



\- gRPC

\- GraphQL

\- SDK

\- Event Bus



\---



\# Architectural Strengths



\- Clean package boundaries

\- Repository abstraction

\- Deterministic execution model

\- Immutable evidence

\- Cryptographic isolation

\- Replay support

\- Testable components

\- Infrastructure independence



\---



\# Architectural Risks



Current risks are limited.



Future considerations:



\- transaction boundaries

\- distributed consistency

\- optimistic concurrency

\- large Trust Record pagination



These are scalability concerns rather than architectural flaws.



\---



\# Future Extensions



The architecture can support:



\- Policy Engine

\- Human Authority

\- Authorization Rules

\- Enterprise Governance

\- Multi-tenancy

\- Audit Analytics

\- Compliance Reporting

\- Key Management

\- Event Streaming



without modifying the core architecture.

\# Conclusion



The Parmana architecture provides a clean, modular, and deterministic foundation for Execution Trust Infrastructure.



Responsibilities are well separated, dependencies are correctly layered, and core trust functionality is isolated from infrastructure concerns.



The architecture is suitable for continued enterprise development without requiring significant redesign.
