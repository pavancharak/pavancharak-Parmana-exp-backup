\# Parmana Architecture



Version: 1.0



\---



\# Overview



Parmana is an \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\* that establishes a verifiable execution trust chain between business authorization, policy evaluation, runtime execution, and execution evidence.



The architecture is designed around explicit trust artifacts rather than implicit runtime state.



\---



\# Architectural Goals



The architecture is designed to:



\* Validate business transactions before execution.

\* Execute exactly one explicitly referenced policy.

\* Produce deterministic policy decisions.

\* Generate cryptographically verifiable execution evidence.

\* Support independent verification.

\* Support deterministic replay.

\* Separate business authorization from runtime execution.

\# Trust Model



Parmana models execution as an explicit trust chain.



```

Authority

&#x20;   ↓

Authorization

&#x20;   ↓

Intent

&#x20;   ↓

Business Transaction

&#x20;   ↓

Policy Reference

&#x20;   ↓

Policy

&#x20;   ↓

Decision

&#x20;   ↓

Execution

&#x20;   ↓

Execution Trust Record

&#x20;   ↓

Receipt

&#x20;   ↓

Verification

&#x20;   ↓

Replay

```



Every downstream artifact is derived from upstream trust artifacts.

\# Major Components



\## Shared



Defines canonical domain models shared across all packages.



Examples:



\* Authority

\* Authorization

\* Intent

\* BusinessTransaction

\* Decision

\* Execution

\* ExecutionTrustRecord

\* Receipt



\---



\## Policy



Responsible for deterministic business policy evaluation.



Responsibilities:



\* Policy loading

\* Policy validation

\* Rule evaluation

\* Decision generation



The Policy package never performs runtime execution.



\---



\## Runtime



Coordinates execution.



Responsibilities:



\* Validate execution preconditions

\* Load the referenced policy

\* Evaluate policy

\* Execute the runtime pipeline

\* Produce execution evidence



The Runtime package never discovers business policies.



\---



\## Crypto



Provides cryptographic integrity.



Responsibilities:



\* Canonical hashing

\* Receipt signing

\* Trust Record verification



Cryptographic algorithms are encapsulated behind provider abstractions.



\---



\## Replay



Supports replay of recorded execution.



Responsibilities:



\* Load historical execution

\* Re-evaluate

\* Compare execution artifacts

\* Detect differences



Replay is intended for verification and analysis.



\---

\# Architectural Principles



\## Explicit Trust



Every execution is linked to explicit business trust artifacts.



\---



\## Deterministic Policy Binding



Business Transactions reference exactly one policy.



The runtime does not discover or negotiate policies.



\---



\## Separation of Responsibilities



Business authorization, policy evaluation, execution, evidence generation, verification, and replay are independent responsibilities.



\---



\## Immutable Evidence



Execution artifacts are treated as immutable evidence.



Derived evidence is generated without modifying upstream artifacts.



\---



\## Cryptographic Integrity



Execution evidence is protected using canonical hashing and digital signatures.



\---



\## Independent Verification



Execution evidence can be verified independently of the original runtime.

\# Non-Goals



Parmana is not:



\* an AI model

\* a workflow engine

\* a business policy authoring tool

\* an identity provider

\* a compliance framework



Parmana provides execution trust infrastructure that can be integrated into those systems.
