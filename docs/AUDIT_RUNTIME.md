\# Runtime Audit



\*\*Version:\*\* v1 Foundation  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-07-03



\---



\# Purpose



This document audits the Runtime layer of the Parmana Execution Trust Platform.



The Runtime is responsible for executing Business Transactions and producing immutable Execution Trust evidence.



\---



\# Runtime Responsibilities



The Runtime coordinates the execution lifecycle while remaining independent of:



\- HTTP

\- Storage

\- Database

\- Transport

\- User Interface



Its responsibilities include:



\- Execute Business Transactions

\- Produce Decisions

\- Record Executions

\- Create Execution Trust Records

\- Support Verification

\- Support Receipt Generation

\- Support Replay



\---



\# Runtime Flow

\# Business Transaction Processing



The Runtime accepts a Business Transaction and coordinates execution.



Input:



\- Authority

\- Authorization

\- Intent

\- Signals

\- Policy

\- Metadata



Output:



\- Decision

\- Execution

\- Execution Trust Record



\---



\# Decision Generation



Each execution produces a deterministic Decision.



Decision includes:



\- Decision ID

\- Outcome

\- Reason

\- Policy

\- Signals

\- Evaluation Time



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Execution Recording



Each approved Decision produces an Execution.



Execution captures:



\- Execution ID

\- Status

\- Start Time

\- Completion Time

\- Evidence

\- Business Transaction ID



Execution evidence becomes immutable.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Execution Trust Record Creation



The Runtime assembles the canonical Execution Trust Record.



The Trust Record contains:



\- Business Transaction

\- Execution

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Signature



Additional lifecycle artifacts are appended later.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Verification Integration



The Runtime supports verification by reconstructing the stored Trust Record.



Verification validates:



\- deterministic hash

\- digital signature



Verification results are appended to the Trust Record.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Receipt Integration



After successful verification, the Runtime supports receipt generation.



Receipts include:



\- Receipt ID

\- Receipt Hash

\- Trust Record Hash

\- Signature

\- Timestamp



Receipts become permanent Trust Record artifacts.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Replay Support



The Runtime supports deterministic replay.



Replay:



\- reconstructs the Trust Record

\- verifies integrity

\- validates signature

\- confirms deterministic consistency



Replay does not execute business logic again.



Status:



\*\*Implemented\*\*



\---



\# Runtime Independence



The Runtime does not depend on:



\- Express

\- HTTP

\- Supabase

\- REST

\- JSON transport



All infrastructure dependencies are injected through interfaces.



This enables reuse across:



\- REST APIs

\- SDKs

\- CLI tools

\- Workers

\- Background services



\---



\# Error Handling



Current Runtime handles:



\- Missing Trust Records

\- Verification failures

\- Receipt generation failures

\- Repository errors

\- Cryptographic failures



Errors propagate through typed application services.



\---



\# Determinism



The Runtime is designed around deterministic execution.



Given the same stored Trust Record:



\- identical canonical serialization

\- identical hash

\- identical signature verification

\- identical replay result



This property enables independent verification.



\---



\# Runtime Components



Primary services include:



\- ExecutionTrustApplication

\- Runtime

\- VerificationService

\- ReceiptService

\- ReplayService



Each service owns a single stage of the execution lifecycle.



\---



\# Testing



Runtime functionality is validated through integration tests covering:



\- Execute

\- Verify

\- Receipt

\- Replay



The complete lifecycle executes successfully against persistent storage.



\---



\# Strengths



\- Deterministic execution model

\- Immutable evidence generation

\- Service-oriented design

\- Infrastructure independence

\- Replay support

\- Cryptographic integration

\- Repository abstraction



\---



\# Future Enhancements



Planned Runtime capabilities include:



\- Policy Engine integration

\- Human approval workflow

\- Authorization enforcement

\- Parallel execution

\- Event publishing

\- Distributed execution

\- Retry strategies

\- Workflow orchestration



These additions extend the Runtime without changing its core architecture.



\---



\# Assessment



| Area | Status |

|-------|--------|

| Execution | Complete |

| Decision Generation | Complete |

| Execution Recording | Complete |

| Trust Record Creation | Complete |

| Verification Integration | Complete |

| Receipt Integration | Complete |

| Replay | Complete |

\---



\# Conclusion



The Runtime successfully implements the core Execution Trust lifecycle.



It coordinates execution, produces immutable evidence, integrates cryptographic verification, supports signed receipts, and enables deterministic replay while remaining independent of transport and persistence technologies.



The Runtime forms the operational core of the Parmana Execution Trust Platform and provides a stable foundation for future enterprise governance and authorization capabilities.
