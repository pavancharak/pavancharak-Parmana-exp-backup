# Deployment

How to run `@parmana/api` as a container, on any Docker-based platform.
Platform-agnostic by design — this was validated with a bare `docker build`
/ `docker run`, not against any specific PaaS's proprietary build system.

## Quick start

```sh
docker build -t parmana-api .

docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e SUPABASE_URL=... \
  -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... \
  -e PARMANA_API_KEYS='[{"callerId":"...","keyHash":"..."}]' \
  -v /path/to/keys:/app/keys:ro \
  parmana-api
```

The process fails closed on missing configuration — see below for exactly
what's required and why. `GET /health` (liveness) and `GET /ready`
(readiness — see [Health checks](#health-checks)) are both served once the
process is up.

## What's in the image

One image, one process, started by `docker/entrypoint.sh`: the API server
(`node packages/api/dist/server.js`). Its exit, for any reason, brings the
container down.

`docker/entrypoint.sh` forwards `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` to the API server and
waits for it to exit before the container exits, so an orchestrator's
graceful-shutdown signal reaches the actual Node process rather than
killing it outright.

## Required configuration

Everything below is validated **eagerly, before the port is bound**
(`assertStorageConfigured`, `assertSigningKeyMaterialConfigured`,
`createCallerAuthenticator`, and friends, all called from `server.ts` before
`app.listen`). A misconfigured process never boots "successfully" and fails
later on the first real request — it exits immediately with a clear error
naming exactly what's missing.

### Signing key material (always required)

Every execution authorization, receipt, verification, and settlement
confirmation is signed. Two key pairs are required in `PARMANA_KEY_DIR`
(default `./keys`, already set in the image):

- `default.private.pem` / `default.public.pem` — the authorization-signing
  key.
- `gateway.private.pem` / `gateway.public.pem` — the Gateway's
  attestation-signing key, deliberately separate (`PARMANA_GATEWAY_KEY_ID`
  overrides the `gateway` id if you need a different one).

Neither is generated automatically. Two ways to provide them:

1. **Mount a volume or platform secret file** at `/app/keys` containing all
   four `.pem` files — the image's `keys/` starts empty on purpose (see
   `.dockerignore`; key material must never be baked into the image).
2. **`PARMANA_KEY_MATERIAL_JSON`** — for platforms with no persistent-volume
   or secret-file primitive. A JSON object,
   `{ "<keyId>": { "privateKeyPem": string, "publicKeyPem": string } }`,
   written to `PARMANA_KEY_DIR` at boot for any file that doesn't already
   exist there (a pre-mounted file always wins, never overwritten). Needs
   entries for both `default` and `gateway` keyIds.

Generate a throwaway pair locally with:

```sh
openssl genrsa -out default.private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in default.private.pem -pubout -out default.public.pem
```

(repeat for `gateway.{private,public}.pem`.)

### Storage (`PARMANA_STORAGE`)

- `memory` (default) — no external dependency; fine for a single-instance
  deployment with no durability guarantee across restarts.
- `supabase` — requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (or
  `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`). Validated eagerly at boot, not lazily on first
  request.

Independent of `PARMANA_STORAGE`: the caller-authentication audit trail
(`CallerAuditSink`) and the envelope-verifier's replay-protection store
(`NonceStore`) are **always** Supabase-backed in production (`NODE_ENV !=
test`) — never falls back to in-memory, regardless of what `PARMANA_STORAGE`
is set to. Both fail closed at startup if `DATABASE_URL` is not configured.
In practice this means a real (non-test) deployment always needs
`DATABASE_URL` set, even if `PARMANA_STORAGE=memory` is chosen for the
business-transaction/execution-trust-record data.

### Applying the schema (Supabase)

`PARMANA_STORAGE=supabase` (or any non-test deployment, per the note above —
`DATABASE_URL`/Supabase is always required for the audit trail and nonce
store) needs the schema in `supabase/migrations/` actually applied to the
target Supabase project. This is a manual step this runbook previously
omitted — the gap surfaced as PostgREST returning `PGRST205` ("Could not
find the table ... in the schema cache") on every request touching an
unapplied table, even though the connection itself was fine and credentials
were valid.

Two ways to apply it:

1. Supabase CLI, if linked to the project: `supabase db push`.
2. No CLI link, or a Dashboard-only workflow: run
   `scripts/apply-all-migrations.sql` (a concatenation of every file in
   `supabase/migrations/`, in chronological order, unmodified) once, in
   full, via the Supabase Dashboard's SQL Editor. Safe to re-run — every
   statement is already idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`,
   `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, etc. — see that file's own header comment).

After applying, PostgREST's schema cache can lag behind the newly created
tables until it reloads. If `GET /ready` (or any Supabase-backed route)
still returns `PGRST205` immediately after applying migrations, force a
reload rather than waiting: Dashboard → Database → API → "Reload schema
cache", or `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` via the SQL Editor.

### Caller authentication (`PARMANA_API_KEYS`)

A JSON array of `{ "callerId": string, "keyHash": string }` entries.
Refuses to start with no caller authentication configured. For local
development only, `PARMANA_AUTH_DISABLED=true` bypasses this (logs a loud
warning on every boot) — never set this in a real deployment.

### Policy directory (`PARMANA_POLICY_DIR`)

Already set to `./policies` in the image (the committed `policies/`
directory is baked in). Override only if a platform needs to mount a
different policy set.

### HubSpot (optional)

Unset by default — the connector simply isn't registered, and the API boots
normally without it. To enable:

- `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` — enables the connector
  (`hubspot:deal-update`, etc.).

### Everything else

`PORT` (default `3000`, read dynamically for platforms — Railway, Render,
Fly — that inject it at deploy time), `LOG_LEVEL`, `CRYPTO_MODE`,
`HASH_PROVIDER`, `PRIMARY_SIGNATURE_PROVIDER`, `TRUST_PROFILE`,
`RECEIPT_VERSION`, `EXECUTION_AUTHORIZATION_TTL_SECONDS`,
`SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `10000`, see below) all have working
defaults and rarely need to be set. See `packages/shared/src/config/Config.ts`
for the authoritative list — it's the only place `process.env` is read for
application config.

## Health checks

- **`GET /health`** — pure liveness, no external dependency touched.
- **`GET /ready`** — readiness: when storage is Supabase-backed, makes one
  cheap `HEAD`-style read against `consumed_nonces` to confirm the
  connection and credentials actually work, returning `503` if not — so an
  orchestrator can tell "up but backed by dead storage" apart from
  "genuinely ready" and route around it. When storage is `memory`, there's
  no external dependency to probe, so it reports ready unconditionally.

## Graceful shutdown

On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`: the API server stops accepting new connections, lets
in-flight requests finish, then exits — the "drain, don't drop" shape a
PaaS orchestrator expects before it force-kills the container.
`SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `10000`) bounds how long a hung in-flight
request (e.g. a stalled downstream call to Supabase or HubSpot) can delay
shutdown before the process force-exits on its own terms.

## Pre-deploy: verify policy changes are approved

`scripts/verify-policy-changes-approved.ts` is the preventive Policy
Governance gate (maker-checker): it confirms every
`policies/{name}/{version}/policy.json` matches a real, signed
`PolicyChangeApprovalRecord` for its exact content, closing the gap that
a direct file edit (or a `git push` straight to `main`, which nothing in
this repo's current GitHub plan technically prevents — see the CI
workflow's own comment) bypasses the maker-checker API entirely. CI runs
this automatically, scoped to whatever `policies/**/policy.json` changed
in a given push or PR. There is no automated deploy pipeline in this
repo to hook the same check into (deployment is the manual
`docker build`/`fly deploy` steps below), so this is the manual backstop:
run it, full-scan, immediately before every deploy.

```sh
SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... \
  npx tsx scripts/verify-policy-changes-approved.ts --full-scan
```

It exits non-zero — and fails closed the same way on a Supabase outage as
on a genuine finding, never silently passing — if any live policy file
doesn't match its most recent approval record.

**The legacy-policy caveat, and what to actually do about it.** Every
policy version that existed before Policy Governance was built has no
approval record at all, because none of them were ever proposed or
approved through the API — they were simply committed. As of this
writing that's all 10 current policy versions (`access-control/1.0.0`,
`connector-capability/1.0.0`, `customer-refund/1.0.0`,
`database-change/3.0.0`, `github-pr-approval/1.0.0`,
`hubspot-deal-update/1.0.0`, `llm-tool-call/1.0.0`,
`production-deployment/1.0.0`, `rag-document-access/1.0.0`,
`vendor-payment/2.0.0`). **The first `--full-scan` run will flag every
one of them — this is correct behavior, not a false positive or a
bug to work around.**

Two legitimate ways to handle this, and only one of them is safe:

- **Treat the first run as informational only.** Run `--full-scan`, read
  the list, don't wire its exit code into anything blocking yet. This is
  the right choice if you're not ready to commit to backfilling coverage
  immediately — it tells you exactly what's currently ungoverned without
  pretending otherwise.
- **Backfill real coverage, one policy at a time.** For each legacy
  policy, propose its *current, unchanged* content as a pending change
  through the real API (`POST /policies/{name}/{version}/pending-changes`)
  and have a genuinely distinct human checker approve it through the real
  step-up flow (`scripts/sign-policy-change-step-up.ts`) — establishing a
  real `PolicyChangeApprovalRecord`, with a real proposer and a real
  checker, for the content as it exists today. This is real, if
  repetitive, human work — a "no-op" proposal per policy, not a rubber
  stamp, since the checker is still expected to actually look at the
  content before approving it.

**Do not** hand-insert rows into `policy_change_approval_records` to make
the check pass, and do not have this script (or any script) synthesize
approval records for content nobody actually reviewed. This table exists
specifically to be trustworthy evidence of who approved what, when — a
backdated or fabricated row would defeat the entire purpose of the
feature it's meant to support, permanently, since there's no way to
later distinguish a real approval from a manufactured one once it's in
the table.

Once backfilled, `--full-scan`'s exit code becomes meaningful as a hard
pre-deploy gate; run it and stop the deploy on failure, the same
discipline CI already applies to PRs.

## Fly.io specifics

Validated this session against a real `parmana-api` Fly app.

- **Secrets**: `scripts/generate-fly-secrets.mjs` generates
  `PARMANA_KEY_MATERIAL_JSON` and `PARMANA_API_KEYS` (single `smoke-test`
  caller) locally (never printed), leaving `SUPABASE_URL` /
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` / `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` as placeholders
  to fill in, then `fly secrets import < .flysecrets/secrets.env` (or `fly
  secrets set PARMANA_STORAGE=supabase` etc. individually) to apply.
  Rotating any secret restarts every machine to pick it up — `fly status`
  should show a recent "last updated" and passing health checks before
  treating the new value as live.
- **Region**: `fly.toml` declares `primary_region = 'bom'`, but machine
  placement is Fly's choice at create time — confirm actual placement with
  `fly status` rather than assuming the configured primary region; this
  deployment's machines run in `lhr`.
- **Smoke test**: `GET /health` and `GET /ready` should both return `200`
  post-deploy; an unauthenticated `POST /execute` should return `401` with
  a `WWW-Authenticate` header, confirming caller auth is actually wired
  rather than accidentally disabled.

## Local verification performed this session

- `docker build` succeeds from a clean checkout.
- No config at all → fails closed with a clear error, exit code `1`
  (signing key material missing).
- Full valid config → `/health` and `/ready` both return `200`; `SIGTERM`
  produces a clean shutdown with no hang and no force-exit.
- `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npx tsc -b` all clean on the code shipped
  in this image.
