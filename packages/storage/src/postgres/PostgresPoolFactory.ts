/**
 * Lazy, process-wide singleton Postgres connection pool. Mirrors
 * SupabaseClientFactory.ts's own singleton pattern, but connects
 * directly to Postgres (via `pg`) instead of going through
 * supabase-js's REST-based client.
 *
 * Introduced as the stopgap direct-Postgres path for
 * SupabaseCallerAuditSink (see that file for why) — not itself tied
 * to that workaround, so any other call site needing a raw Postgres
 * connection to the same
 * database should reuse this factory rather than opening its own
 * pool.
 *
 * SSL: relies on DATABASE_URL's own `sslmode` query parameter (`pg`
 * parses it via `pg-connection-string`); Supabase connection strings
 * already include `sslmode=require`.
