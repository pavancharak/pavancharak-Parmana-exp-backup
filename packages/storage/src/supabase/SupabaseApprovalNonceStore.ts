/**
 * Durable, Supabase-backed NonceStore for Approval Artifact nonces
 * (TD-23 closure, Phase 3C).
 *
 * Deliberately backed by its own table (consumed_approval_nonces),
 * separate from consumed_nonces (SupabaseNonceStore, ExecutionGateway's
 * own Authorization-envelope replay protection) -- per
 * docs/architecture/phase3a-authorization-artifact-design.md §13, an
 * Approval Artifact's nonce and a Gateway authorization envelope's
 * nonce are distinct trust domains issued by distinct parties (an
 * external business approver vs. Parmana's own runtime); sharing one
 * table would let a coincidental nonce collision between the two
 * unrelated namespaces falsely report "already consumed" for one
 * because of the other, and would couple two independent replay-
 * protection concerns' retention/cleanup lifecycles together for no
 * benefit.
 *
 * Otherwise structurally identical to SupabaseNonceStore -- same
 * interface, same atomicity mechanism (a single INSERT whose PRIMARY
 * KEY on `nonce` is the entire mechanism; a 23505 unique_violation
 * means "already consumed", every other error is rethrown, fail
 * closed), same NODE_ENV=test / production split convention
 * (see packages/api/src/bootstrap/createApprovalNonceStore.ts).
