/**
 * Structural runtime guard for a caller-supplied JSON value claimed to
 * be a SignedApproval -- e.g. a PolicySignals["approvalArtifact"]
 * entry, which arrives over the wire as an untyped JsonValue, never as
 * a real SignedApproval instance the way Parmana's own self-issued
 * signatures (RefusalCrypto, AuditEventCrypto, etc.) are constructed
 * directly in memory.
 *
 * Duck-types every field ApprovalVerifier.verify() actually reads.
 * Deliberately does not require signature.signedAt to be a Date
 * instance (JSON transport always yields a string, if present at all,
 * and ApprovalVerifier never reads this field -- it is
 * caller-provenance metadata only, not verified state).
 *
 * Does not, and need not, validate the signature itself -- that is
 * ApprovalVerifier's own job. A value that fails this guard is simply
 * treated as "no approval artifact presented," never thrown -- fails
 * closed the same way a fetch error or missing field does elsewhere in
 * this codebase's SignalStateVerifier implementations.
