 * createConnectorAuthenticator.ts's trusted-connector-identity list.
 * Revoking one compromised or offboarded approver's key instantly
 * invalidates every artifact they ever signed, a coarser but simpler
 * and operationally real guarantee than tracking individual
 * approvalIds. Per-artifact revocation remains a possible future
 * refinement (see docs/architecture/phase3c-approval-artifact.md,
 * Remaining Limitations) -- not implemented here.
