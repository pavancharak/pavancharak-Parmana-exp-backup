 * hardcoded trusted-connector-identity list exactly: provisioning a
 * new approver, or revoking/rotating an existing one's key, means
 * adding or editing an entry here and deploying -- the same
 * operational model already established for trusted connector
 * identities. A self-service onboarding flow for approvers is
 * deliberately out of scope (see
 * docs/architecture/phase3a-authorization-artifact-design.md §17,
 * Open Question #1) -- this list only verifies against whatever
 * entries it is deployed with.
 *
 * Empty by default: no real business-approver key has been
 * provisioned yet. This is the correct fail-closed starting state --
 * every preAuthorizedForAmountChange claim is rejected
 * (ApprovalVerifier.verify's issuerKnown check fails for every
 * artifact) until an operator adds a real entry here and provisions
 * the matching public key file below, rather than silently trusting
 * an unconfigured default.
