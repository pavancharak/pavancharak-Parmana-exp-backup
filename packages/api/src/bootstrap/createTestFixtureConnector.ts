 * registered capability to execute against when submitted through the
 * real POST /execute route — the same role `createVendorPaymentConnector`
 * used to play, before `payments:execute`/vendor-payment was removed
 * entirely (docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md G-27) rather than independently
 * verified. Deliberately named and capability-scoped away from
 * `payments:execute`/`vendor-payment`: this is not a payment capability
 * of any kind, carries no production implication, is never registered
 * outside NODE_ENV=test, and has no entry in
 * CANONICAL_CAPABILITY_POLICY_BINDINGS (the same "unbound, entirely
 * unaffected by CapabilityPolicyBinder" category every other test/
 * tutorial/example fixture action already falls into).
