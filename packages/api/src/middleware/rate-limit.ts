 * anything. Mounted only when caller authentication is enabled (see
 * app.ts): req.callerId does not exist at all when callerAuth is
 * "disabled" (local development only), and rate-limiting an anonymous
 * route by a caller identity that doesn't exist isn't a meaningful
 * control.
 *
 * Runs as ordinary Express middleware, ahead of the route handler
 * (createExecuteRouter): a rejected request never reaches
 * BusinessTransactionMapper, policy evaluation, or
 * RuntimeAuthorizationSigner — no nonce is consumed, nothing is
 * signed, for a request this middleware rejects.
 *
 * In-memory store (express-rate-limit's default): correct for a
 * single process, but each of this deployment's machines counts
 * independently — the effective ceiling for a caller is
 * `limitPerMinute * machineCount`, not fleet-wide. See CLAIMS.md
 * for this scope caveat stated as a claim, not just a comment.
