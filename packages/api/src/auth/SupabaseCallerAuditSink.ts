/**
 * Durable, Supabase-backed CallerAuditSink. Closes G-13
 * (docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md) for the caller-authentication audit
 * trail: events now survive a process restart instead of living only
 * in InMemoryCallerAuditSink's process-local array (still the correct
 * choice for tests — see
 * packages/api/src/bootstrap/createCallerAuditSink.js).
 *
 * Signed at write time (audit-sink signing milestone, following
 * RFC-0021's Refusal Records): a plain durable row could previously
 * be altered by anyone with database access with no way to detect
 * it. Signs the event exactly as given, before any storage-only
 * field (insert timestamp, row id) is added — the same discipline
 * VerificationCrypto/RefusalCrypto already apply. Uses the same
 * signing stack and key (DEFAULT_KEY_ID) as every other signed
 * artifact in this codebase; see AuditEventCrypto.
 *
 * Failure semantics: unchanged from InMemoryCallerAuditSink. record()
 * has always been an unguarded `await` in
 * middleware/caller-auth.ts — that call site has no try/catch today,
 * and this class does not add one. A write failure here rejects the
 * returned promise exactly like any other failed Supabase insert
 * elsewhere in this codebase (SupabaseBusinessTransactionRepository,
 * SupabaseExecutionTrustRecordRepository); it is the caller's
 * existing behavior, unmodified by this class, that decides what
 * happens next. See docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md G-13 for why this is
 * documented rather than changed in this session.
 *
 * CallerAuditEvent.capability (caller-capability-scoping milestone,
 * supabase/migrations/20260812120000_add_capability_to_caller_audit_
 * events.sql) is signed as part of the event
 * (this.crypto.sign(event) below covers the full object) and written
 * to its own nullable column here, the same as every other optional
 * field — null on events that don't concern a specific capability
 * (caller.authenticated, caller.rejected).
 *
 * TEMPORARY WORKAROUND: writes via a direct Postgres connection (see
 * PostgresPoolFactory), not supabase-js — PostgREST's schema cache is
 * stuck refusing to see signature_json on this table (Supabase ticket
 * SU-437429), confirmed at Supabase's PostgREST layer specifically,
 * not the database or this codebase. Raw SQL bypasses PostgREST's
 * REST layer (and its schema cache) entirely. Revert to supabase-js
 * (`this.client.from("caller_audit_events").insert(...)`, as before)
 * once Supabase confirms the cache issue is resolved.
