/**
 * Authenticates callers against a static, pre-hashed set
 * of API keys.
 *
 * Keys are never held in plaintext: only a SHA-256 hash
 * of each key is compared, so a leak of this process's
 * config never yields a usable secret. Every comparison
 * runs in constant time against the hash bytes, never the
 * raw key.
 *
 * Multiple entries may share the same callerId, which is
 * how key rotation works: add the new key's hash, keep the
 * old one active during migration, then remove the old
 * entry to revoke it. No downtime, no code change.
