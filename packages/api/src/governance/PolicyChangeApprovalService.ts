 * Resolves an approved PendingPolicyChange into its two durable
 * effects: the live policies/{name}/{version}/policy.json write, and
 * a signed PolicyChangeApprovalRecord -- see PendingPolicyChange's
 * and PolicyChangeApprovalRecord's own doc comments for why neither
 * exists until this service runs.
 *
 * Must be called from the approve route handler BEFORE
 * PendingPolicyChangeRepository.resolve, never after: if the write or
 * the signing fails, the pending change must remain PENDING_APPROVAL,
 * not be left APPROVED with no corresponding live effect.
 *
 * Rejections never call this service -- see PendingPolicyChange's own
 * doc comment: a rejected change's rejectionReason is itself the
 * durable evidence a rejection leaves behind.
 *
 * The write target is `proposedContent.policyVersion`, not the
 * PendingPolicyChange's own `policyVersion` ("the version being
 * replaced") -- see PendingPolicyChange's own doc comment for why
 * those can legitimately differ.
