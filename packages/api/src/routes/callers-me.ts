/**
 * Creates the /callers/me router.
 *
 * The proof artifact a buyer's security review asks for: "show me
 * this agent's identity and exactly what it's authorized to do."
 * Read-only, self-lookup only (an authenticated caller sees its own
 * record, never another caller's), and never returns key material --
 * identity and resolved scope only.
 *
 * Resolved, not raw: allowedPrincipalIds/allowedCapabilities reflect
 * the *effective* scope after defaults are applied (see
 * isPrincipalAllowed.ts and isCapabilityAllowed.ts), not the raw
 * ApiKeyEntry configuration -- a reader should not need to know the
 * "unset allowedPrincipalIds defaults to self, unset
 * allowedCapabilities defaults to none" rules to answer "what can
 * this caller do."
