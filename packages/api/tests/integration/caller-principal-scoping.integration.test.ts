/**
 * HTTP-level proof that a principal-binding violation (an authenticated
 * caller asserting an authority.principalId it isn't permitted to assert)
 * is now durably audited, closing the evidence-completeness gap found
 * during a broader gap audit: isPrincipalAllowed's rejection previously
 * wrote no record of any kind -- only the routine caller.authenticated
 * event that fires at the middleware layer before this check even runs --
 * while the structurally adjacent isCapabilityAllowed rejection, a few
 * lines below it in the same route file, already wrote a signed
 * caller.capability_denied record. Both checks were always correctly
 * fail-closed (both return 403, no bypass ever existed); this closes the
 * audit-trail asymmetry between them, not a security hole.
 *
 * Mirrors caller-capability-scoping.integration.test.ts's own shape and
 * conventions exactly, one layer over: caller.principal_denied instead of
 * caller.capability_denied, allowedPrincipalIds instead of
 * allowedCapabilities.
