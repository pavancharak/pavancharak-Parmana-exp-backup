 * packages/execution-control/tests/unit/session-credential-secure-connector.test.ts
 * already proves "a session credential is issued and destroyed exactly
 * once per execution" by calling SessionCredentialSecureConnector.execute()
 * directly. This test proves the SAME guarantee holds through a real
 * POST /execute HTTP request against the real Express app, using the
 * real ExecutionGateway / SessionCredentialExecutionControl /
 * ExecutionControlService / SessionCredentialSecureConnector chain — the
 * library-level guarantee, converted into a boundary-level one.
 *
 * Each test builds its own inspectable execution system (see
 * ../bootstrap/createInspectableExecutionSystem.ts) rather than importing
 * the shared ../test-app.js singleton, because this test needs a direct
 * reference to the audit sink and session credential vault, which the real
 * production bootstrap chain does not expose.
