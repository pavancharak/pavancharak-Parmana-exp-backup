/**
 * The first network call this codebase ever makes to a real GitHub
 * endpoint (api.github.com), gated exactly like
 * hubspot-live.integration.test.ts gates on ALLOW_LIVE_HUBSPOT — see
 * resolveGitHubLiveGate's comment and packages/api/README.md.
 *
 * Deliberately no mutating (merge) case, unlike hubspot-live's own
 * "deal update (mutating)" block. HubSpot's mutating case is safe
 * because a deal's amount is a numeric field: nudge it, verify, revert
 * to the original value, and the deal is exactly as found. A GitHub PR
 * merge has no equivalent: merging closes the PR and adds a merge
 * commit to the base branch's history; there is no general, safe "revert
 * a merge" operation this suite could automate without either being
 * fictional (force-pushing a branch ref does not undo a merge commit
 * already on the base branch, and risks destroying unrelated commits if
 * the ref moved) or requiring its own separate merge (a revert commit
 * via a revert PR), which reintroduces the same "how do we undo *that*"
 * problem one level down. Proving the real merge path end to end is left
 * to a deliberate, manual live run against a disposable test PR the
 * operator has already decided is fine to leave merged -- not something
 * this suite performs unattended.
 *
 * What this suite does prove, live, unattended, and non-destructively:
 *
 *   1. The full ephemeral-credential mint -> connector dispatch chain
 *      reaches GitHub's real API (either the access_tokens exchange or
 *      the merge endpoint itself responds, depending on which layer the
 *      configured test credentials are valid for) -- driven through the
 *      real, installable @parmana/sdk package, over a real listening
 *      HTTP server, mirroring hubspot-live.integration.test.ts's own
 *      rationale for doing so instead of driving the in-process Express
 *      app object directly.
 *   2. Policy denial still makes zero real GitHub calls when a real
 *      GitHub connector (not a mock) is wired in -- the same
 *      "policy-denial-makes-zero-calls" proof as the hermetic suite,
 *      reinforced here against the production connector.
 *
 * Prerequisite: `npm run build` in typescript/ must have already
 * produced dist/ -- already true in CI and after any local `npm run
 * build` at the repo root.
