/**
 * Strategic-positioning validation follow-up: "We Are Not in the AI Race"
 * claims the same authorization mechanism governs execution regardless of
 * whether the request originated from an AI agent, a human, an
 * application, or any other system -- i.e. authorization depends only on
 * whether the requested action is authorized, never on who or what is
 * asking. Prior to this file that property was only an *inference* from
 * the absence of any `authority`-reading code in RuntimeEngine/
 * PolicyEngine/SignalIntentBinder/CapabilityPolicyBinder (confirmed by
 * direct grep: zero references to `authority` in any of those four
 * files). This file makes it a direct, executable proof instead.
 *
 * BusinessTransactionMapper.fromRequest (packages/api/src/mappers/
 * BusinessTransactionMapper.ts:28) does `request.authority as Authority`
 * -- a blind cast, with no runtime validation of `authorityType` against
 * the AuthorityType enum (USER | ROLE | SERVICE | ORGANIZATION). That
 * means an arbitrary, even nonsensical, authorityType string reaches the
 * runtime unfiltered -- the strongest possible test of "this mechanism is
 * blind to caller kind" is to send one and confirm the outcome is
 * byte-for-byte identical to a conventional USER transaction, for both
 * the APPROVE and REJECT paths.
