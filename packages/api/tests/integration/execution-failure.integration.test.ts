/**
 * Phase 2D — restored.
 *
 * Previously `describe.skip`, with the stated reason "the current
 * RuntimeFactory always creates a DefaultExecutionSystem internally,
 * making it impossible to inject a failing implementation." That
 * blocker is gone — `RuntimeFactory.create()` now requires an
 * `ExecutionSystem` as a constructor argument rather than building one
 * itself — but restoring this test required more than deleting `.skip`:
 * the original assertions (`response.body.execution.status === "FAILED"`,
 * `response.body.error` containing `"Execution System"`) never matched
 * any response shape this API actually produces. `errorHandler`
 * (packages/api/src/middleware/error-handler.ts) maps an unrecognized
 * thrown error to a generic `{ error: "Internal Server Error" }` 500,
 * by design, specifically so internal failure detail is never leaked to
 * a caller — confirmed empirically before rewriting this file, not
 * assumed. See docs/architecture/phase2d-execution-failure-testing.md
 * for the full investigation.
 *
 * Uses createInspectableExecutionSystem (already used by
 * credential-isolation.integration.test.ts and others) to inject a
 * connector executor that deterministically throws, through the real
 * ExecutionGateway / ExecutionControlService / SessionCredentialSecureConnector
 * chain — not the shared ../test-app.js singleton, which has no
 * mechanism to inject a failing implementation at all.
 *
 * credential-isolation.integration.test.ts already proves the
 * credential-issue-then-destroy guarantee for this same failure shape;
 * this file's distinct job is the HTTP response contract and the
 * evidentiary absence (no Trust Record, no Receipt, no fabricated
 * success) — properties nothing else in the suite currently asserts.
