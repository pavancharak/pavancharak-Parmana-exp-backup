 * Resolves whether the live-gated GitHub suite should run, enforcing the

 * TEST_GITHUB_* triple being configured is not by itself enough to run
 * against GitHub's real API. ALLOW_LIVE_GITHUB=1 must also be set
 * explicitly, or the suite skips cleanly rather than silently making a
 * real network call -- a default `npm test` on a machine with test
 * credentials configured stays green and side-effect-free. Explicitly
 * requesting a live run with ALLOW_LIVE_GITHUB=1 but no visible
 * credentials is a hard failure, not a skip, for the same reason
 * resolveHubSpotLiveGate treats it that way: explicit intent must never
 * quietly degrade to a silent skip.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT validate TEST_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY's shape the
 * way resolveHubSpotLiveGate validates its token's "pat-" prefix -- a PEM
 * private key has no single fixed prefix to check, and an invalid key
 * fails safely anyway: signGitHubAppJwt's own createSign(...).sign() call
 * throws before any network call is made, so a malformed key can never
 * reach GitHub's API in a way that looks like a real (if wrong) exchange.
