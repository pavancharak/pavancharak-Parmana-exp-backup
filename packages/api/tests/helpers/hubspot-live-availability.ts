 * silently making a real network call — a default `npm test` on a
 * machine with a test token configured stays green and side-effect-free.

 * visible token is a hard failure, not a skip, for the same reason
 * resolveRazorpayLiveGate treats it that way: explicit intent must never
 * quietly degrade to a silent skip.

 * suite mutates a real HubSpot object (a deal's dealstage/amount), so
 * once a live run is confirmed, TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN must
 * start with "pat-" or the whole suite aborts hard, before any network
 * call is made — a malformed token must never quietly proceed.
