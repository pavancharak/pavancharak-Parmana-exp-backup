/**
 * Capability/Policy Binder.
 *
 * A capability whose `boundSignals`/`SignalStateVerifier` protections
 * are scoped to one specific policy is only actually protected by them
 * when that specific policy is the one evaluated. Nothing upstream of
 * this class enforces that: `PolicyRouter`/`FilePolicyRepository` load
 * whatever `policy.name`/`policy.version` the caller declares,
 * `PolicyEngine.evaluate` takes no `action` parameter at all, and
 * `DefaultConnectorPolicy.assertAllowed` checks only that the resolved
 * connector declares the capability, never which policy authorized it.
 * A caller could therefore pair a real capability (e.g.
 * `razorpay:refund-create`) with an unrelated, unprotected policy that
 * has no `boundSignals` for it, evaluate that policy's own (looser)
 * rules against self-declared signals, and have the real, unrelated
 * `intent.parameters` executed -- bypassing the capability's intended
 * protections entirely, not merely weakening them.
 *
 * This class closes that gap structurally: for any capability present
 * in `CANONICAL_CAPABILITY_POLICY_BINDINGS`, the declared policy
 * reference MUST equal the canonical one, or the request is rejected
 * before a policy file is even evaluated against it. Capabilities with
 * no canonical entry are unaffected -- caller-declared policy selection
 * for those is unchanged.
