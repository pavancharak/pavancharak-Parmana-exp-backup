 * Combines multiple capability-scoped SignalStateVerifiers into one.
 *
 * Each SignalStateVerifier implementation is expected to recognize only
 * the action(s) it knows how to independently verify and return an
 * empty array for anything else -- RazorpaySignalStateVerifier and
 * HubSpotSignalStateVerifier both follow this discipline. This composite
 * queries each in the order supplied and returns the first non-empty
 * result, so RuntimeEngine (which accepts exactly one
 * SignalStateVerifier) can be wired with as many capability-specific
 * verifiers as the production route needs.
