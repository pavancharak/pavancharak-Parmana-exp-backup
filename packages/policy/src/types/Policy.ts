   * Signals are caller-declared and are what PolicyEngine.evaluate
   * decides approval on; Intent is what ExecutionGateway actually
   * signs and executes. Nothing else in the system requires these
   * two to describe the same real-world action — a caller could

   * value at the given dot-path into { target, parameters } read
   * from the real Intent, or the transaction is rejected outright,
   * before any authorization is generated.
   *
   * Only signals with a genuine Intent-side equivalent belong here
   * (e.g. an amount or a target/vendor identifier). Signals that
   * represent an external fact with no Intent-side equivalent (for
   * example vendorVerified or riskScore) are not expressible as a
   * binding and remain ordinary caller-declared signals — binding
   * them is a separate, larger problem (deriving them from an
   * independently verified source) than this mechanism solves.
