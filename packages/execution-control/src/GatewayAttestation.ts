/**
 * Payload the Gateway signs to prove it possesses the Gateway's private
 * key. authorizationId binds the attestation to one specific request so
 * it cannot be replayed to authenticate a DIFFERENT request.
 *
 * nonce is an entropy/uniqueness field only — nothing in this file or in
 * SignedTokenConnectorAuthenticator records consumed nonces, so it is not
 * itself a replay defense. It exists so two attestations minted for the
 * same authorizationId (e.g. a retried call) are distinguishable, and so
 * the signed payload isn't otherwise fully deterministic from
 * (gatewayId, authorizationId, issuedAt) alone. Replay of the SAME
 * attestation against the SAME request is prevented elsewhere: the
 * single-use GatewaySession (InMemoryGatewaySessionStore, existing,
 * unmodified) rejects a second execution attempt once a session has been
 * consumed, and replay of the underlying SignedExecutionAuthorization
 * itself is the responsibility of @parmana/envelope-verifier's NonceStore,
 * upstream of everything in this package. If this attestation's nonce
 * needs to independently defend against replay in the future, a consumer
 * would need to track seen (gatewayId, nonce) pairs — nothing here does.
