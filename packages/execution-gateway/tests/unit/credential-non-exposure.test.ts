/**
 * Credential lifecycle (Claim 1 audit, 2026-08-19 independent claims
 * review): the one property of "no actor ever holds a working execution
 * credential" that hubspot-connector.test.ts did not already assert
 * explicitly.
 *
 * Every other property this audit asked for — token redaction to a
 * one-way fingerprint, error-message isolation, response-metadata
 * safety, and zero HubSpot API calls on a policy denial — already has
 * real, passing coverage:
 *   - hubspot-connector.test.ts: "never leaks the token into a thrown
 *     error", "never places the token or any substring of it in
 *     connector response metadata, only a one-way fingerprint"
 *   - packages/api/tests/integration/hubspot-deal-update.integration.test.ts:
 *     fetch-spy proof of literally zero calls to the HubSpot mock server
 *     on POLICY_DENIED, at the full RuntimeEngine -> API level (stronger
 *     than a connector-local check, since it proves the connector is
 *     never even reached, not merely that it declines to act).
 * This file adds only the missing one: that GatewayHubSpotAdapter never
 * retains a resolved credential as instance state between calls.
