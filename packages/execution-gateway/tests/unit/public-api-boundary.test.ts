 * Phase 1D architecture guard: proves the connector-execution
 * implementation classes are internal, not part of the package's public
 * surface. If any of these ever get re-added to src/index.ts (directly or
 * via `export * from "./connector-execution/index.js"`), this test fails
 * — the same signal Task 5/6's "no downstream package imports the
 * implementation classes" guarantee depends on staying true.
 *
 * ExecutionGateway remains the sole public execution entry point;
 * connector-execution's public surface is limited to the three
 * createGateway*() factories, which return stable interface types
 * (Connector, ConnectorRegistry) rather than the concrete classes below.
