/**
 * ExecutionGateway's connector-execution layer.
 *
 * Canonical production implementation of the connector-registration,
 * credential-backed execution, and execution-dispatch responsibilities
 * execution-control's seams (ConnectorRegistry, CredentialVault,
 * ConnectorExecutor) define. Migrated from @parmana/connector-sdk (Phase
 * 1C) — connector packages retain only capability definitions, schemas,
 * metadata, and interfaces; this is where those get wired into a real,
 * running execution path.
 *
 * Internal barrel (Phase 1D): this file is imported by the package's own
 * tests via a relative path, not through ../index.ts. The implementation
 * classes below (ConnectorEvidence, CredentialVaultAdapter,
 * SdkConnectorExecutor, GatewayCapabilityConnectorPolicy,
 * GatewayConnectorRegistry, GatewayHubSpotAdapter, GatewayHttpAdapter,
 * GatewayGitHubAdapter, GitHubAppCredentialProvider) are NOT re-exported
 * from ../index.ts — the package's public surface is the createGateway*()
 * factories plus the GatewayConnectorRegistration DTO, which construct
 * and return these classes without exposing them.
