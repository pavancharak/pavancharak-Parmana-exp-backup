/**
 * Recursively freezes an object graph.
 *
 * Object.freeze() alone is shallow: a frozen object
 * whose properties are themselves objects (for
 * example, ExecutableContent.parameters) can still
 * have those nested objects mutated. This walks the
 * graph and freezes every plain object and array it
 * reaches.
 *
 * This is defense-in-depth only. The Gateway's
 * integrity guarantee comes from the hash comparison
 * in ExecutionGateway.verify, not from freezing —
 * freezing only stops the frozen value from being
 * mutated in-process between verification and the
 * Connector call.
