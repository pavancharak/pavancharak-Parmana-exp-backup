 * Canonical public API.
 *
 * The Execution Gateway is the sole boundary through which
 * Parmana releases approved execution requests to Connectors,
 * within Parmana-mediated execution for systems integrated
 * behind it (see docs/CLAIMS.md for the exact scope of this
 * claim). It is a new execution boundary built around the
 * existing @parmana/envelope-verifier machinery — it does not
 * modify RuntimeEngine, RuntimePipeline, or any other core
 * decision-flow component. It plugs into the existing
 * ExecutionSystem seam (see @parmana/execution-system) exactly
 * like any other ExecutionSystem implementation.
