/**
 * Pending Policy Change (Policy Governance, maker-checker).
 *
 * Parmana previously took no position on who may author or change a
 * policy document -- GOVERNANCE.md, SECURITY.md, and TRUST_MODEL.md
 * all named policy authoring as external to Parmana's scope. This
 * type is the first artifact of that scope changing: a proposed
 * change to an existing policy's content, held in a durable pending
 * state until a second, distinct human explicitly approves or
 * rejects it. Nothing in this file writes to `policies/` directly --
 * see PendingPolicyChangeRepository and the service that resolves an
 * approval into a filesystem write and a signed
 * PolicyChangeApprovalRecord.
 *
 * `proposedContent` is deliberately typed as JsonValue, not
 * `@parmana/policy`'s `Policy` type: `@parmana/shared` sits below
 * `@parmana/policy` in the dependency graph (policy depends on
 * shared, never the reverse), so this package cannot reference that
 * type without an import cycle. Structural validation against the
 * Policy schema (PolicyValidator) happens one layer up, before a
 * PendingPolicyChange is ever created -- this type only guarantees
 * "some JSON was proposed," never "the JSON is a valid policy."
