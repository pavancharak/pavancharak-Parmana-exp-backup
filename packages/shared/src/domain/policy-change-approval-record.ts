 * Policy Change Approval Record (Policy Governance, maker-checker).
 *
 * Durable, signed, permanent evidence that a specific human (checker)
 * approved a specific human's (maker) proposed change to a specific
 * policy's content -- created exactly once, at the moment a
 * PendingPolicyChange is approved. Rejections produce no record of
 * this type; a rejected PendingPolicyChange (with its
 * rejectionReason) is itself the evidence a rejection leaves behind.
 *
 * Signed with the same signing mechanism, key, and canonicalization
 * as ExecutionTrustRecord (see PolicyChangeCrypto in @parmana/crypto,
 * which reuses VerificationCrypto's own CryptoBootstrap/
 * FileKeyProvider/ArtifactSigner rather than a separate signer) --
 * this is deliberately the same trust root, not a parallel one.
 *
 * `contentHashBefore`/`contentHashAfter` are sha256 hashes (via the
 * same CanonicalSerializer + SHA256HashProvider pair every other hash
 * in this codebase uses) of the canonicalized policy JSON immediately
 * before and after this approval -- the G-24 remediation's content-
 * addressed evidence, so a later audit can confirm exactly what
 * content this approval covered, not merely which version string.
