 * Parmana Trust Core
 *
 * Approval Artifact (TD-23 closure, Phase 3C)
 *
 * A cryptographically verifiable, independently-issued attestation
 * that a specific external business authority approved a specific,
 * bounded fact about a specific capability and business object --
 * replacing a caller-declared authorization assertion (e.g.
 * `preAuthorizedForAmountChange: true`) that Parmana's own
 * Execution Authorization cannot truthfully represent, because the
 * Execution Authorization proves Parmana's own runtime approved a
 * Decision, not that an independent business authority approved an
 * exception to it.
 *
 * Design frozen in docs/architecture/phase3a-authorization-artifact-design.md
 * (§7). This file implements that specification's schema exactly --
 * field names, types, and mandatory/optional status are not
 * reinterpreted here.
 *
 * Trust Chain (mirrors ExecutionAuthorizationPayload's own doc
 * comment style):
 *
 * Business Approval (an authority independent of the AI caller and
 *   of Parmana's own runtime)
 *      ↓
 * Approval Artifact (this type)
 *      ↓
 * Canonical Serialization (CanonicalSerializer, reused verbatim)
 *      ↓
 * Signature (the issuer's own key -- never Parmana's runtime key)
 *      ↓
 * Verification (@parmana/approval's ApprovalVerifier)
 *      ↓
 * Policy (the verified fact populates a policy signal, replacing the
 *   caller's own declared value)
