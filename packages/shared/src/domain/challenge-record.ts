/**
 * Challenge Record (RFC-0022).
 *
 * A durable, structured trace of one specific challenge to a Parmana
 * claim or assumption: what was challenged, who/how it surfaced, what
 * was actually checked (the investigation method, not only the
 * conclusion), the finding, what changed as a result (if anything),
 * and whether/where it was disclosed.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT signed — see RFC-0022 § Proposal 3. A
 * ChallengeRecord is evidence of an organizational process (a human
 * or agent deciding what to investigate and what it means), not a
 * runtime transaction outcome; the party who could misrepresent it is
 * the same party who writes it, so a signature would prove
 * tamper-evidence of bytes-on-disk while leaving the actual trust
 * question (was the investigation honest) unaddressed. Trustworthy
 * instead through citation discipline (every investigation step and
 * finding should cite something independently checkable) and, where
 * applicable, public disclosure — the same discipline docs/CLAIMS.md
 * and docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md already rely on with no cryptography.
 *
 * Append-only, per ADR-0005-Evidence-Is-Append-Only.md, but unlike
 * RefusalRecord (a single terminal event with nothing to append to),
 * a ChallengeRecord is investigated over real time: investigationSteps
 * accumulates, and status moves forward (open -> investigating ->
 * resolved) without ever reopening by mutating a prior entry — a
 * challenge believed resolved that later needs more work becomes a
 * NEW ChallengeRecord linked via `supersedes`, not an edit to this
 * one. See ChallengeRecordRepository.append, which enforces this.
