/**
 * Resolves a GitHub App installation access token — the ephemeral
 * credential model this connector exists to prove out (Claim 1 audit,
 * 2026-08-19), structurally different from HubSpot's static
 * caller-provided token.
 *
 * CredentialProvider.resolve() is called fresh by the Execution Gateway
 * immediately before each execution, never cached or reused by anything
 * upstream of this class — so implementing "mint a new short-lived token
 * per execution, never store it" required no new mechanism, only an
 * implementation of the same interface HubSpot's static-token model
 * already uses. That is itself evidence the credential-isolation pattern
 * generalizes across credential models, not just across connectors that
 * happen to share one model.
 *
 * The App's private key is held only by this class, in memory, exactly
 * as supplied at construction. It signs one JWT per resolve() call (see
 * GitHubAppJwt), exchanges that JWT for an installation token via
 * GitHub's REST API, and returns only the resulting token — the private
 * key itself is never included in the returned CredentialHandle, never
 * logged, and never appears in any error message this class throws.
