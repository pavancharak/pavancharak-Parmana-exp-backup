 * stage (a deal can be marked lost from anywhere in the funnel).
 * Backward transitions, and any transition out of a terminal stage
 * (closedwon/closedlost), are never allowed.
 *
 * OPEN DECISION (deliberately not resolved this milestone — see
 * docs/CLAIMS.md): this is one GLOBAL stage order, not configured
 * per-pipeline. A HubSpot account with multiple pipelines (each with its
 * own stage ids and ordering) is not represented — a proposedDealStage
 * that happens to share a stage id with this default order is evaluated
 * against it regardless of which pipeline the deal actually belongs to.
 * Per-pipeline configuration (keying this map by the deal's own
 * `pipeline` property) is real future work, not implemented here.
