 *
 * This guard exists because the Razorpay connector's very first version
 * did not have one: its built-in test-mode placeholder key_id could be
 * sent straight to Razorpay's real production API, and only survived
 * because Razorpay happened to reject it. That was an accident of
 * Razorpay's behavior, not a guarantee this codebase controlled — see
 * docs/CLAIMS.md 3.4's "defense-in-depth fix" paragraph. HubSpotConnector
 * closes the same gap from its first version instead of after an
