 * Phase 2C — regression coverage for the CI terminology guard
 * (.github/workflows/ci.yml, "Guard against retired terminology" step).
 *
 * The guard itself is inline bash with no test of its own — this is what
 * let TD-2 (repository-certification.md TD-2) go unnoticed: the guard
 * silently failed against the committed tree with nobody finding out until
 * someone happened to run it by hand. This file re-implements the guard's
 * exact matching logic in TypeScript so its behavior is asserted on every
 * `npm test` run, not just when CI happens to execute the workflow step.
 *
 * The exclusion list below MUST be kept in sync with ci.yml's `--exclude`
 * flags by hand — there is no shared source of truth, the same tradeoff
 * documentation-references.test.ts already accepts for its own doc list.
 * If you change one, change the other.
