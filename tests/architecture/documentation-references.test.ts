/**
 * Extension of the same check above, for a different citation shape: prose

 * `[CLAIMS.md 3.6](docs/CLAIMS.md)`, `CLAIMS.md 3.6 through 3.9`, etc. — no
 * single exact phrase covers every citation style actually in use, so this
 * matches on proximity: any `N.M` token found shortly after the literal
 * string "CLAIMS.md" on the same line) rather than a file path. Two real
 * instances of this exact bug surfaced during the Razorpay removal
 * (2026-08-12): a citation to `3.4` and an implied `3.6 through 3.9` range,
 * both pointing at sections deleted outright (not renumbered) alongside the
 * connector. A follow-up scan of the whole repo found two more — including
 * docs/CLAIMS.md citing its own deleted §3.4 — confirming this rots
 * silently and is worth guarding, same as the path check above.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the living, currently-accurate documentation
 * surface only: docs/CLAIMS.md itself, the customer/investor-facing docs
 * site (docs/site/**\/*.mdx), and the root-level docs that track the same
 * present-tense state (README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, SECURITY.md). The
 * audit-trail (docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md, docs/architecture/phase*.md,
 * docs/ROADMAP-v1.md, etc.) is deliberately excluded, for the same reason
 * docsToCheck above never included them: those are dated investigation
 * logs that correctly cite a section number as it existed at the time of
 * writing, not living documentation expected to track the present.
 *
 * No allowlist for intentional historical section citations exists here
 * (unlike HISTORICALLY_REAL_NOW_REMOVED_PATHS above) because none of the
 * citations found when this check was written were deliberate — every one
 * was ordinary staleness from an unrelated deletion, not a citation
 * authored with foreknowledge that its target would later be removed. If a
 * genuine case like that shows up, follow HISTORICALLY_REAL_NOW_REMOVED_PATHS's
 * precedent above rather than building something new.
