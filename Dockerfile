# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#
# Multi-stage build for @parmana/api. Platform-agnostic (Dockerfile-first):
# builds a single container image that runs both the HTTP API and the
# Razorpay settlement poll loop (see docker/entrypoint.sh for why they
# share a container at this stage, and the trade-off that comes with it).
# Works unmodified on any Docker-based PaaS (Railway, Render, Fly, a bare
# `docker run`, ...).
#
# The list of packages/*/package.json COPY lines below is intentionally
# explicit rather than a single `COPY packages ./packages` glob: it lets
# stage 1 (deps) cache correctly on dependency changes without being
# invalidated by every source edit, which a whole-directory copy would
# defeat.

# openapi bundling step -- openapi/openapi.bundled.yaml is committed and

# Stage 3: prod-deps -- a second, independent `npm ci --omit=dev`. Kept as
# its own fresh install (not a prune of stage 1's tree) because correctly
# pruning an npm-workspaces node_modules in place is fragile with
# hoisting; a second install from the same lockfile is simpler and more
# reliable, at the cost of a slower build (acceptable trade-off here).

# Stage 4: runtime -- the image the platform actually runs.
#
# node:24-slim, not -alpine: docker/entrypoint.sh is a small bash
# supervisor (see that file's own comment for why bash specifically --
# `wait -n`, not available in POSIX sh/dash or BusyBox ash), and
# node:24-slim ships bash by default. Chasing alpine's smaller base would
# mean `apk add bash` anyway, for savings this stage doesn't need.
#
# Runs as the non-root `node` user node:24-slim already provides (uid
# 1000) -- never root.

# deliberate trade-off (see DEPLOYMENT.md): adding it to the build graph
# so it ships as compiled JS like everything else is reasonable follow-up
# work, not done in this packaging session. tsx is small (no full
# TypeScript devDependency tree needed at runtime for this one script).
